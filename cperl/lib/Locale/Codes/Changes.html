<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>Locale::Codes::Changes - details changes to Locale::Codes</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p>This describes the changes made to modules in the Locale-Codes distribution. Major changes are marked with asterisks (*). For the most part, all modules have remained backward compatible at every release, but occasionally a change is made which is backward incompatible. These are marked with an exclamation mark (!).</p>

<p>As of 3.00, the codes are autogenerated from the standards. With each release, codes will be re-generated and tested to see if any code changed. Any time there are any changes to the codes, it will be flagged below with a change: NEW CODE(s).</p>

<p>I intend to check for new codes four times a year (March, June, September, December). I will also check on request, so if a code changes that you use, feel free to contact me. Any time there are new codes, I will add them to the module and release a new version.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Fixed-the-default-error-condition-in-legacy-modules">Fixed the default error condition in legacy modules.</dt>
<dd>

<p>With the addition of the OO module, better error handling was added (and it was on by default). The non-OO (legacy) modules did not report errors, so code that uses them, would now behave differently if invalid data were passed in.</p>

<p>I have turned off error handling by default in the legacy modules. The show_errors method was added to each of the non-OO modules to report errors if desired.</p>

<p>NEW CODE(s)</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Tests-no-longer-require-.-in-INC">Tests no longer require (.) in INC</dt>
<dd>

<p>As of perl 5.25.11, (.) is being removed from INC. I had to adjust the tests accordingly.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="VERSION-3.50-2017-03-01-sbeck">VERSION 3.50 (2017-03-01; sbeck)</h1>

<p>NEW CODE(s)</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Rewrote-as-OO-module"><b>(*) Rewrote as OO module</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The core module (Locale::Codes) is now an OO module that can be used directly. All of the other modules (Locale::Codes::TYPE) are still the older functional interfaces and remain unchanged.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Added-some-constants"><b>Added some constants</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Historically, the constant names used to identify the codesets have been named inconsistently. The original constants for codesets are:</p>

<pre><code>   Type      Constants

   country   LOCALE_CODE_*
   currency  LOCALE_CURR_*
   language  LOCALE_LANG_*

   script    LOCALE_SCRIPT_*
   langfam   LOCALE_LANGFAM_*
   langvar   LOCALE_LANGVAR_*
   langext   LOCALE_LANGEXT_*</code></pre>

<p>For consistencies sake, I have added some new codes (which are otherwise identical to the irregularly named codes):</p>

<pre><code>   country   LOCALE_COUNTRY_*
   currency  LOCALE_CURRENCY_*
   language  LOCALE_LANGUAGE_*</code></pre>

<p>Going forward, all constants will include the full name of the code type.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Non-OO-modules-are-now-generated">Non-OO modules are now generated</dt>
<dd>

<p>All non-OO modules are now automatically generated. This will make it easier to keep them 100% consistent as well as making it easier to add new types of code sets.</p>

<p>All of the documentation for them is also generated except for the description of the code sets. That has been moved into the Locale::Codes::Types document.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Fixed-a-bug-where-constants-were-not-exported">Fixed a bug where constants were not exported</dt>
<dd>

<p>Some of the constants for some of the newer code sets were not exported properly. This was fixed when I started generating the non-OO modules, but was reported (after I had already fixed it in development) as RT 119741 .</p>

<p>The UN codes have been added back in as their own list of codes. Jarkko Hietaniemi</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Added-GENC-codes"><b>Added GENC codes</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The GENC codes have been added. These are the new US Government codes that replace the FIPS-10 codes. They are based on, but not identical to the ISO 3166 codes.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="VERSION-3.38-2016-03-02-sbeck">VERSION 3.38 (2016-03-02; sbeck)</h1>

<p>NEW CODE(s)</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Removed-alias_code-function"><b>(!) Removed alias_code function</b></dt>

<p>The alias_code function was preserved for backward compatibility, but has been deprecated since 3.20. It has been removed.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="VERSION-3.35-2015-06-01-sbeck">VERSION 3.35 (2015-06-01; sbeck)</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="Filled-out-LOCALE_LANG_TERM-codeset"><b>Filled out LOCALE_LANG_TERM codeset</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The terminologic language codes only included codes from languages where the ISO specified both a bibliographic code and a terminologic code. If both are not specified, the better solution was to use the code for both code sets. Prompted by a suggestion by Jarkko Hietaniemi.</p>

<dt id="ISO-3166-country-codes-improved"><b>ISO 3166 country codes improved</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>ISO 3166 is now browsable online (previously, only the alpha-2 codes were) and it contains more accurate information than the previous sources, so I&#39;ve switched to using the full standard. In response to RT 92303 which reported some codes being &#39;retired&#39; that should not have been.</p>

</dd>

<dt id="FIPS-10-country-codes-removed"><b>* FIPS-10 country codes removed</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>As of June, the FIPS codes are not being published in their entirety. Only changes to the codes are published. This adds a huge layer of complexity to maintaining the set, which is not worth doing considering that the set is deprecated. As such, the code set is no longer supported.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Syria-alias"><b>Syria alias</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Syria added as an alias. RT 82747</p>

</dd>
<dt id="FIPS-10-country-codes-deprecated"><b>FIPS-10 country codes deprecated</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The FIPS-10 document is being withdrawn. It was deprecated in 2008, and is being updated now only until all the agencies that use it have switched to something else. The current version no longer lists the long names for countries. These long names (such as &#39;Republic of Albania&#39; for Albania) only appeared in the old FIPS-10 document which is no longer available, so they are no longer available in this module.</p>

<p>I will continue to support the FIPS-10 codeset as long as it is available, but at that point, it will be withdrawn immediately. If an official end-of-life date is announced, I will include a notice here. Otherwise, support for the codeset will be discontinued when the document is withdrawn.</p>

<p>You are encouraged to no longer use the FIPS-10 codeset.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Domain-country-codes-now-come-from-ISO-3166"><b>Domain country codes now come from ISO 3166</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The IANA domain codes have changed slightly. The IANA no longer publishes a list of countries associated with their codes. Instead, they use the ISO 3166 codes and country names. However, they support a few non-standard codes, so I will continue to maintain this codeset. The domain codes are now lowercase to correspond to the ISO 3166 codes.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t seem like reasonable behavior, so it has been changed to allow the same code set:</p>

      =&gt; &#39;bo&#39;</code></pre>

<p>NEW CODE(s)</p>

<dl>

<dt id="New-maintainer"><b>(*) New maintainer</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>From 1997 to 2004, Locale::Codes was maintained by Neil Bowers. Unfortunately, no updates were made from June 2004 to January 2010. During that time, a number of changes have been made to the standards since then, so the data included was out-of-date.</p>

<p>I contacted Neil to get his permission to assume maintenance of the module, and he kindly agreed.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="All-codes-are-generated-from-standards"><b>(*) (!) All codes are generated from standards</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>All of the values returned by the various functions are now values directly from the standards. This means that the values returned in the 2.xx series are not necessarily the same as the values returned here.</p>

<p>As an example, the ISO 3166 standard which lists country codes refers to the country associated with the code &quot;bo&quot; as &quot;Bolivia, Plurinational State of&quot;, so that is what is returned. In the 2.xx series, &quot;Bolivia&quot; was returned. Also, the country names vary from one standard to another. So the code &quot;bol&quot; which is maintained by the United Nations returns the name of the country as &quot;Bolivia (Plurinational State of)&quot;. Some common aliases have been added, so you can still request a code associated with a county name &quot;Bolivia&quot;.</p>

<p>Since the data comes from the standards, some &quot;incorrect&quot; values are no longer supported. For example, 2.07 treated &quot;Zaire&quot; as an alias for &quot;Congo&quot;, but the country changed it&#39;s name, and &quot;Zaire&quot; is not in the standard, so it has been dropped in 3.00.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Added-new-codeset-s2"><b>Added new codeset(s)</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>FIPS 10 country codes (requested in RT 1755)</p>

<p>Alpha-3 and Term language codes (requested in RT 11730)</p>

<p>Numeric currency codes (requested in RT 18797)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Locale::Script-changed"><b>(*) (!) Locale::Script changed</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>In 2.xx, Locale::Script assigned scripts to country codes, which is NOT how it is done currently in the standards. It appears that an older version of ISO 15924 did this, but I haven&#39;t found an old version to confirm that, and in any case, that is not the case in the current standards.</p>

<p>As a result, the Locale::Script module is completely incompatible with the 2.xx version with respect to the types of codes it supports. None of the old codes will work.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Added-missing-functions"><b>Added missing functions</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>I&#39;ve added in some functions which were &quot;missing&quot; previously (since there was only one set of codes supported, the code2code functions didn&#39;t apply):</p>

<pre><code>   language_code2code
   currency_code2code</code></pre>

<p>so the interfaces for each type of codes are consistent.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Dropped-support-for-_alias_code"><b>(!) Dropped support for _alias_code</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>In Locale::Country, _alias_code was an allowed, but deprecated function which was documented to be supported in the 2.xx series. I&#39;ve removed it.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="All-functions-return-the-standard-value"><b>(!) All functions return the standard value</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>code2country (and other equivalent functions) now returns the name of the country specified in the standard (if the different standards refer to the country by different variations in the name, the results will differ based on the CODESET)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="rename_country-function-altered"><b>(!) rename_country function altered</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The rename_country function from 2.07 would guess the CODESET (unlike all other functions which used a default of LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2). The guess can cause problems since (with the addition of FIPS) codes may appear in different codesets for different countries. The behavior has been changed to be the same as other functions (default to LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2).</p>

<p>The alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes for East Timor have changed: tp -&gt; tl tmp -&gt; tls the numeric code stays 626. If you want to support the old codes, you can use the semi-private function alias_code().</p>

<h1 id="VERSION-2.00-2002-02-17-neilb">VERSION 2.00 (2002-02-17; neilb)</h1>

<p>Created Locale::Script which provides an interface to the ISO codes for identification of scripts (writing scripts, rather than perl style scripts). The codes are defined by ISO 15924, which is currently in final draft. Thanks to Jarkko for pointing out this new standard. All three code sets are supported, and a test-suite added.</p>

<p>Added support for country name variants to Locale::Country, so that country2code(&#39;USA&#39;) country2code(&#39;United States&#39;) country2code(&#39;United States of America&#39;) will all return &#39;us&#39;. This had been in the LIMITATIONS section since the first version. Patch from TJ Mather with additional variants from me. Added test-cases for these.</p>

<p>Added VERSION to Locale::Constants. Thanks to Jarkko for pointing that it was missing.</p>

<p>Should really have bumped major version with previous release, since there was a change to the API.</p>

<h1 id="VERSION-1.06-2001-03-04-neilb">VERSION 1.06 (2001-03-04; neilb)</h1>

<p>Added Locale::Constants, which defines three symbols for identifying which codeset is being used:</p>

<pre><code>   LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
   LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
   LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC</code></pre>

<p>Updated Locale::Country to support all three code sets defined by ISO 3166. This was requested by Keith Wall. I haven&#39;t added multiple codeset support to the other modules yet - I&#39;ll wait until someone asks for them.</p>

<h1 id="VERSION-1.05-2001-02-13-neilb">VERSION 1.05 (2001-02-13; neilb)</h1>

<h1 id="VERSION-1.03-2000-12--neilb">VERSION 1.03 (2000-12-??; neilb)</h1>

<p>Updated Locale::Country: - fixed spelling of a few countries - added link to a relevant page from CIA world factbook</p>

<p>Updated Locale::Language: - fixed typo in the documentation (ISO 939 should be 639)</p>

<h1 id="VERSION-1.02-2000-05-04-neilb">VERSION 1.02 (2000-05-04; neilb)</h1>

<p>Updated Locale::Country and Locale::Language to reflect changes in the relevant ISO standards. These mainly reflect languages which are new to the relevant standard, and changes in the spelling of some country names.</p>

<p>Added official URLs for the standards to the SEE ALSO sections of the doc for each module.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for pointing me at the pages with latest versions of ISO 3166 and 639.</p>

<h1 id="VERSION-1.00-1998-03-09-neilb">VERSION 1.00 (1998-03-09; neilb)</h1>

<p>Added Locale::Country::_alias_code() so that &#39;uk&#39; can be added as the code for &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, if you want it. This was prompted by Ed Jordan.</p>

<p>Added a new test suite for handling this case, and extended the existing test-suite to include testing of the case where &#39;uk&#39; hasn&#39;t been defined as a valid code.</p>
