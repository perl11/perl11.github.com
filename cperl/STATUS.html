<h1>cperl status</h1>

<p>cperl started Feb. 2015 when :const was added, parrot was killed, the
trust in the maintenance capabilities of p5p eroded beyond repair, and
it became clear that optimizing for fun is better than waiting for
someone else to allow it.</p>

<p>A 5.22 based variant with classes ("perl with classes"), types,
compiler support ("compilable perl"), or just a company-friendly perl.</p>

<p>Currently it is about 1.5x faster than perl5.22 overall, >2x faster
then 5.14 and uses the least amount of memory measured since 5.6,
i.e. less than 5.10 and 5.6.2, which were the previous leaders. While
perl5.22 uses the most memory yet measured.  But not all of the wanted
features are merged.  The plan is to support most perl5-compatible
perl6 features, improve performance and memory usage, better compiler
(B::C) support, and provide better security fixes and maintenance than
p5p perl5.</p>

<p>Tested and developed on linux and darwin 64bit. 32bit does not work yet!</p>

<p>The first release based on 5.22.1 is scheduled on Sep 14. 2015.</p>

<p>All tests pass, most of CPAN works, 3 fixes in the distroprefs repo
for Variable::Magic and CPAN::Meta::Requirements and version are needed.</p>

<p>Issues will be copied over from our internal stash repo to the public
github repo soon.</p>

<li>fix ops using lexical $_</li>
<li>add some unicode ops</li>
<li>improved build system (make -s, faster, CC vs LD confusion)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Almost ready branches (only minor tests are failing)</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>feature/CM-600-cperl-cowrefcnt
works, but does not do COW yet</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-367-cperl-warnings-xs-carp</p></li>
<li>feature/CM-367-cperl-carp-builtin</li>
<li><p>feature/CM-370-cperl-warnings-xs
much faster and much less memory, but 3 minor scope test fails.</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-317-cperl-signatures3
2x faster</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-317-cperl-signatures3-CM-690-nl
newlines in sigs broken</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-916-cperl-no-miniperl
fix the Makefile deps</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-626-cperl-use-dots
works, but unsure</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>A bit more work is needed for</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>feature/CM-713-cperl-native-types
some compiler fixes needed</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-707-cperl-inline-subs
some compiler fixes needed</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-712-cperl-types-proto
constant fold everything</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-322-cperl-new-hash-table
lots of attempts, but still too hairy. needs a complete hash rewrite probably.</p></li>
<li><p>feature/CM-910-cperl-multi
class, method and multi keywords</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Soon</h1>

<ul>
<li>user facing types and classes, multiple dispatch</li>
