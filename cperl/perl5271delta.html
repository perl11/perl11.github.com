<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perl5271delta - what is new for perl v5.27.1</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.27.0 release and the 5.27.1 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.26.0, first read <a href="/cperl/perl5270delta.html">perl5270delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.26.0 and 5.27.0.</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<h2 id="delete-on-key-value-slices"><a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#delete-EXPR"><code>delete</code></a> on key/value slices</h2>

<p><a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#delete-EXPR"><code>delete</code></a> can now be used on key/value slices, returning the keys along with the deleted values. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=131328">[perl #131328]</a></p>

<h1 id="Security">Security</h1>

<h2 id="Default-Hash-Function-Change">Default Hash Function Change</h2>

<p>Perl 5.27.1 retires various older hash functions which are not viewed as sufficiently secure for use in Perl. We now support four general purpose hash functions, Siphash (2-4 and 1-3 variants), and Zaphod32, and StadtX hash. In addition we support SBOX32 (a form of tabular hashing) for hashing short strings, in conjunction with any of the other hash functions provided.</p>

<p>By default Perl is configured to support SBOX hashing of strings up to 24 characters, in conjunction with StadtX hashing on 64 bit builds, and Zaphod32 hashing for 32 bit builds.</p>

<p>You may control these settings with the following options to Configure:</p>

<pre><code>    -DPERL_HASH_FUNC_SIPHASH
    -DPERL_HASH_FUNC_SIPHASH13
    -DPERL_HASH_FUNC_STADTX
    -DPERL_HASH_FUNC_ZAPHOD32</code></pre>

<p>To disable SBOX hashing you can use</p>

<pre><code>    -DPERL_HASH_USE_SBOX32_ALSO=0</code></pre>

<p>And to set the maximum length to use SBOX32 hashing on with:</p>

<pre><code>    -DSBOX32_MAX_LEN=16</code></pre>

<p>The maximum length allowed is 256. There probably isn&#39;t much point in setting it higher than the default.</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<h2 id="Comma-less-variable-lists-in-formats-are-no-longer-allowed">Comma-less variable lists in formats are no longer allowed</h2>

<p>Omitting the commas between variables passed to formats is no longer allowed. This has been deprecated since Perl 5.000.</p>

<h2 id="The-:locked-and-:unique-attributes-have-been-removed">The <code>:locked</code> and <code>:unique</code> attributes have been removed</h2>

<p>These have been no-ops and deprecated since Perl 5.12 and 5.10, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="N-with-nothing-between-the-braces-is-now-illegal"><code>\N{}</code> with nothing between the braces is now illegal.</h2>

<p>This has been deprecated since Perl 5.24.</p>

<h2 id="Opening-the-same-symbol-as-both-a-file-and-directory-handle-is-no-longer-allowed">Opening the same symbol as both a file and directory handle is no longer allowed</h2>

<p>Using <code>open()</code> and <code>opendir()</code> to associate both a filehandle and a dirhandle to the same symbol (glob or scalar) has been deprecated since Perl 5.10.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-bare-to-mean-is-no-longer-allowed">Use of bare <code>&lt;&lt;</code> to mean <code>&lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;</code> is no longer allowed</h2>

<p>Use of a bare terminator has been deprecated since Perl 5.000.</p>

<h2 id="Setting-to-a-reference-to-a-non-positive-integer-no-longer-allowed">Setting $/ to a reference to a non-positive integer no longer allowed</h2>

<p>This used to work like setting it to <code>undef</code>, but has been deprecated since Perl 5.20.</p>

<h2 id="Unicode-code-points-with-values-exceeding-IV_MAX-are-now-fatal">Unicode code points with values exceeding <code>IV_MAX</code> are now fatal.</h2>

<p>This was deprecated since Perl 5.24.</p>

<h2 id="B::OP::terse-no-longer-exists"><code>B::OP::terse</code> no longer exists.</h2>

<p>Use <code>B::Concise::b_terse</code> instead.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-inherited-AUTOLOAD-for-non-methods-is-no-longer-allowed">Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-methods is no longer allowed.</h2>

<p>This was deprecated in Perl 5.004.</p>

<h2 id="Use-of-strings-with-code-points-over-0xFF-is-not-allowed-for-bitwise-string-operators">Use of strings with code points over 0xFF is not allowed for bitwise string operators</h2>

<p>Code points over <code>0xFF</code> do not make sense for bitwise operators.</p>

<h2 id="Setting-ENCODING-to-a-defined-value-is-now-illegal">Setting <code>${^ENCODING}</code> to a defined value is now illegal</h2>

<p>This has been deprecated since Perl 5.22 and a no-op since Perl 5.26.</p>

<h2 id="Backslash-no-longer-escapes-colon-in-PATH-for-the--S-switch">Backslash no longer escapes colon in PATH for the -S switch</h2>

<p>Previously the <code>-S</code> switch incorrectly treated backslash (&quot;\&quot;) as an escape for colon when traversing the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. [perl #129183]</p>

<h2 id="the--DH-DEBUG_H-misfeature-has-been-removed">the -DH (DEBUG_H) misfeature has been removed</h2>

<p>On a perl built with debugging support, the <code>H</code> flag to the <code>-D</code> debugging option has been removed. This was supposed to dump hash values, but has been broken for many years.</p>

<h1 id="Deprecations">Deprecations</h1>

<h2 id="Use-of-vec-on-strings-with-code-points-above-0xFF-is-deprecated">Use of <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#vec-EXPR-OFFSET-BITS"><code>vec</code></a> on strings with code points above 0xFF is deprecated.</h2>

<p>Use of these is nonsensical, as <code>vec</code> is a bit-oriented operation, which operates on the underlying UTF-8 representation these strings must be in, and will likely give unexpected results.</p>

<h2 id="Some-uses-of-unescaped-are-no-longer-fatal">Some uses of unescaped <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> are no longer fatal</h2>

<p>Perl 5.26.0 fatalized some uses of an unescaped left brace, but an exception was made at the last minute, specifically crafted to be a minimal change to allow GNU Autoconf to work. This code is heavily depended upon, and continues to use the deprecated usage. Its use of an unescaped left brace is one where we have no intention of repurposing <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> to be something other than itself.</p>

<p>That exception is now generalized to include various other such cases where the <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> will not be repurposed. This is to get real experience with this more complicated change now, in case we need to issue a dot release if we find other things like Autoconf that are important to work around.</p>

<p>Note that these uses continue to raise a deprecation message.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><a>File::Glob</a> has been modified to remove unnecessary backtracking and recursion, thanks to Russ Cox. See <a href="https://research.swtch.com/glob">https://research.swtch.com/glob</a> for more details.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>ref()</code> builtin is now much faster in boolean context, since it no longer bothers to construct a temporary string like <code>Foo=ARRAY(0x134af48)</code>.</p>

</li>

<li><p>Perl now includes a default <i>.travis.yml</i> file for Travis CI testing on github mirrors. [perl #123981]</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Platform-Support">Platform Support</h1>

<h2 id="Platform-Specific-Notes">Platform-Specific Notes</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="Windows">Windows</dt>
<dd>

<ul>

<li><p>Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (containing Visual C++ 14.1) has been added.</p>

</li>
</ul>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="Internal-Changes">Internal Changes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>PL_statbuf</code> interpreter variable has been removed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The deprecated function <code>to_utf8_case()</code>, accessible from XS code, has been removed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A new function <a href="/cperl/perlapi.html#is_utf8_invariant_string_loc"><code>is_utf8_invariant_string_loc()</code></a> has been added that is like <a href="/pod/perlapi.html#is_utf8_invariant_string"><code>is_utf8_invariant_string()</code></a> but takes an extra pointer parameter into which is stored the location of the first variant character, if any are found.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Fetching the name of a glob that was previously UTF-8 but wasn&#39;t any longer would return that name flagged as UTF-8. [perl #131263]</p>

</li>
<li><p>The perl <code>sprintf()</code> function (via the underlying C function <code>Perl_sv_vcatpvfn_flags()</code>) has been heavily reworked to fix many minor bugs, including the integer wrapping of large width and precision specifiers and potential buffer overruns. It has also been made faster in many cases.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Exiting from an <code>eval</code>, whether normally or via an exception, now always frees temporary values (possibly calling destructors) <i>before</i> setting <code>$@</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    sub DESTROY { eval { die &quot;died in DESTROY&quot;; } }
    eval { bless []; };
    # $@ used to be equal to &quot;died in DESTROY&quot; here; it&#39;s now &quot;&quot;.</code></pre>

</li>
</ul>
