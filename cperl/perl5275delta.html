<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Calling <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#exec-PROGRAM-LIST">exec PROGRAM LIST</a> with an empty <code>LIST</code> has been fixed. This should call <code>execvp()</code> with an empty <code>argv</code> array (containing only the terminating <code>NULL</code> pointer), but was instead just returning false (and not setting <a href="/cperl/perlvar.html#pod"><code>$!</code></a>). <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131730">[perl #131730]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>The <code>gv_fetchmeth_sv</code> C function stopped working properly in Perl 5.22 when fetching a constant with a UTF-8 name if that constant subroutine was stored in the stash as a simple scalar reference, rather than a full typeglob. This has been corrected.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Single-letter debugger commands followed by an argument which starts with punctuation (e.g. <code>p$^V</code> and <code>x@ARGV</code>) now work again. They had been wrongly requiring a space between the command and the argument. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=120174">[perl #120174]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p><a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#splice-ARRAY-OFFSET-LENGTH-LIST">splice</a> now throws an exception (&quot;Modification of a read-only value attempted&quot;) when modifying a read-only array. Until now it had been silently modifying the array. The new behaviour is consistent with the behaviour of <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#push-ARRAY-LIST">push</a> and <a href="/cperl/perlfunc.html#unshift-ARRAY-LIST">unshift</a>. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=131000">[perl #131000]</a></p>

<h1 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Perl 5.27.5 represents approximately 4 weeks of development since Perl 5.27.4 and contains approximately 29,000 lines of changes across 430 files from 20 authors.</p>

<p>Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 17,000 lines of changes to 340 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.</p>

<p>Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.27.5:</p>

<p>Aaron Crane, Chris &#39;BinGOs&#39; Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Manns&aring;ker, Dmitry Ulanov, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, John P. Linderman, John SJ Anderson, Lukas Mai, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Smylers, Steve Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Zefram.</p>

<p>The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>

<p>Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl&#39;s core. We&#39;re grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of all of Perl&#39;s historical contributors, please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 id="Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at <a href="https://rt.perl.org/">https://rt.perl.org/</a> . There may also be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <a>perlbug</a> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see <a href="/cperl/perlsec.html#SECURITY-VULNERABILITY-CONTACT-INFORMATION">&quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec</a> for details of how to report the issue.</p>

<h1 id="Give-Thanks">Give Thanks</h1>

<p>If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running the <code>perlthanks</code> program:</p>

<pre><code>    perlthanks</code></pre>

<p>This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.</p>
