<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perl5223cdelta - what is new for cperl v5.22.3</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.22.2 release and the cperl 5.22.3 release.</p>

<p>For <b>cperl</b> also see <i>Changes</i> and <a href="/cperl/perlcperl.html">perlcperl</a></p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>installperl ensures now that <i>$prefix/bin/perl</i> is created. (#144) This fixes <b>perlbrew</b> without explicit cperl support, and needs special care for packagers not to overwrite an existing <i>bin/perl</i>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>New reader <code>CHECK_type_ATTRIBUTES</code> callbacks are called within the check phase for every attribute, falling back to <code>FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Less <code>-Wnonnull-compare</code> compilation warnings, use more <code>_NN</code> macros. I.e. dont check for arguments which cannot be null.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<dd>

<p>Add support for utf8 and binary subroutine names and packages. Taken from <a href="https://github.com/rurban/sub-name/commits/binary">https://github.com/rurban/sub-name/commits/binary</a></p>

<p>Various minor fixes. See <a href="https://github.com/Scalar-List-Utils/Scalar-List-Utils/pull/44">https://github.com/Scalar-List-Utils/Scalar-List-Utils/pull/44</a></p>

</dd>
<dt id="B-C-1.54_06">B-C 1.54_06</dt>
<dd>

<p>With some cperl-specific improvements.</p>

<p>Handle cperl OP_SIGNATURE, at least the simple variants. Fix refcount of cop hints hashes with 5.22-nt (#220) Better UVX L and U suffices, Handle shared IV and UV xpv structs.</p>

<p>No strcpy. replace with my_strlcpy in ByteLoader</p>

</dd>
<dt id="DynaLoader-2.02c">DynaLoader 2.02c</dt>
<dd>

<p>Fixed VERSION check with @INC callbacks (#148). Reset stack after INC callbacks.</p>

<p>Fixes <i>Class-Accessor-Grouped/t/accessors_pp.t</i></p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<dl>

<dt id="Fix-for-my-var-regression">Fix <code>for my$var</code> regression</dt>
<dd>

<p>Fixed cperl-5.22.2 regression causing the error &quot;Missing $ on loop variable&quot;. Also with <code>for our$</code> (#145)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Fix-FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES-callbacks">Fix FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES callbacks</dt>
<dd>

<p>Both arguments to <code>FETCH_type_ATTRIBUTES</code> callbacks were wrong. The first was an unassignable stash and is now the package name, and the 2nd was a cv and is now a cvref. This was broken in cperl5.22.1 and cperl5.22.2 (#147)</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Wrong-Cant-find-Unicode-property-definition-error">Wrong &quot;Can&#39;t find Unicode property definition&quot; error</dt>
<dd>

<p>The &quot;Can&#39;t find Unicode property definition&quot; error was called even with <code>!SvPOK retval</code>, caused by misleading indentation in utf8.c</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>cperl 5.22.3 represents approximately 3 weeks of development since Perl 5.22.2c and contains approximately 2,800 lines of changes across 72 files from 1 author.</p>

<p>Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 410 lines of changes to 34 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.</p>

<p>Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.3:</p>

<p>Reini Urban, ribasushi.</p>

<p>The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>

<p>Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl&#39;s core. We&#39;re grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of all of Perl&#39;s historical contributors, please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution</p>

<h1 id="Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at <a href="https://rt.perl.org/">https://rt.perl.org/</a> . There may also be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <code>perlbug</code> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to <code>perlbug@perl.org</code> to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If you think it&#39;s a cperl specific bug or trust the cperl developers more please file an issue at <a href="https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues">https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues</a>.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it to <code>perl5-security-report@perl.org</code>. This points to a closed subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the p5p core committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.</p>

<p>If you trust the cperl developers more, please send an email to them. The p5p security teams skips many security issues, or are unwilling to fix them.</p>
