<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perlcperl - a perl5 with classes, types, compilable, company friendly</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p>Description of changes and enhancements of the cperl variant of perl5.</p>

<h1 id="DEVELOPMENT-SETUP">DEVELOPMENT SETUP</h1>

<pre><code>    git remote add cp ssh://git@github.com/perl11/cperl.git
    git fetch cp
    git checkout -t cp master
    git config rerere enable
    git config rerere.autoupdate true
    ln -s ../.git-rr-cache .git/rr-cache
    git branch -r | grep cp/</code></pre>

<p>We need a shared rerere cache to be able to continously merge and rebase with perl5 upstream and our branch progress. See <a href="https://medium.com/@porteneuve/fix-conflicts-only-once-with-git-rerere-7d116b2cec67">https://medium.com/@porteneuve/fix-conflicts-only-once-with-git-rerere-7d116b2cec67</a> The commits with <i>git-rr-cache</i> and <i>cp-rb</i> in the Subject can be safely ignored upstream.</p>

<p>All branches are frequently rebased. Use the provided helpers <i>cp-rb</i>, <i>cp-rbi</i>, <i>cp-lb</i> and <i>cp-rh</i>.</p>

<p>The tip of the best performance branch is currently <code>feature/CM-712-cperl-types-proto</code>, and the memory saving branch is <code>feature/CM-370-cperl-warnings-xs</code>.</p>

<p><b>INSTALL:</b></p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-changes">Incompatible changes</h1>

<p>cperl tries to follow the old perl5 spirit and principles, unlike recent perl5 changes, which wildly deviate from it.</p>

<p>cperl can parse and run 99.9% all of perl5 code. But there are a few incompatibilities, which arise from late perl5 signatures design changes and 2002 constant folding changes which we do not follow. perl5 signatures are marked as experimental after all.</p>

<p>CPAN works. 2 modules currently need patches in our distroprefs repo.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Illegal-prototypes-die-are-not-stored">Illegal prototypes die, are not stored</dt>
<dd>

<p>In perl illegal prototypes warn with <code>&#39;illegalproto&#39;</code> and are stored as such.</p>

<p>In cperl illegal prototypes in signatures used without <code>:prototype()</code> immediately die, they cannot be suppressed with <code>no warnings &#39;illegalproto&#39;;</code> and they are not stored.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> Illegal prototypes are parsed as signatures. Illegal signatures throw a parser error. The <code>&#39;illegalproto&#39;</code> warning is only thrown within explicit extra <code>:prototype()</code> declarations.</p>

<p>Technically this is not a incompatible change, as signatures are marked as experimental.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="is-empty-in-functions-with-signatures"><code>@_</code> is empty in functions with signatures</dt>
<dd>

<p>We only copy or reference arguments to signature variables, but not to <code>@_</code> also. <code>@_</code> is empty when signatures are declared.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> With signatures copying all values to <code>@_</code> also leads to double copying which is 2x slower. <code>@_</code> is not needed anymore. Either use no signatures to use <code>@_</code> variables or use sigantures.</p>

<p>Technically this is not a incompatible change, as signatures are marked as experimental.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Empty-signature-variables-die">Empty signature variables <code>$</code> die</dt>
<dd>

<p>Using a bare <code>$</code> sigil signature variable is illegal in cperl, but legal in perl.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> This clashes with prototypes. A bare <code>$</code> is a prototype declaration, not a signature. Use a name in the signature and don&#39;t use this name in the body to get back to the same behaviour.</p>

<p>Technically this is not a incompatible change, as signatures are marked as experimental.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="negative-integer-modulo">negative integer modulo</dt>
<dd>

<p>With typed integer variables or integer constants the modulo operator in cperl works like with use integer, it uses the libc functionality for <code>&quot;%&quot;</code>; using the <code>i_modulo</code> operator which is different than the generic perl5 <code>modulo</code> operator.</p>

<p>Perl5 without use integer uses a different modulo definition: <i>&quot;If $n is negative, then $m % $n is $m minus the smallest multiple of $n that is not less than $m (that is, the result will be less than or equal to zero)&quot;</i> from <a href="/pod/perlop.html#Multiplicative-Operators">&quot;Multiplicative Operators&quot; in perlop</a>.</p>

<p>cperl with typed or constant integers behaves like perl5 with use integer or before 2002, when this was changed (<code>e7311069</code>). The compiler simply promotes <code>modulo</code> to <code>i_modulo</code> if both arguments are integers at compile-time. To fall back to the old behavior use untyped variables and no integer.</p>

<pre><code>    perl5:
    -13 % 4 =&gt; 3
    13 % -4 =&gt; -3
    {
      use integer;
      -13 % 4 =&gt; -1
      13 % -4 =&gt; 1
    }

    cperl:
    -13 % 4 =&gt; -1
    13 % -4 =&gt; 1

    # old perl5 behavior:
    {
      no integer;
      ($a,$b) = (-13,4);
      $a % $b =&gt; 3
    }</code></pre>

<p><b>Background:</b> In <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2001/10/msg45590.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2001/10/msg45590.html</a> p5p was arguing that it is using the mathematical &quot;correct&quot; semantics, vs this definition from the C standards committee: <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf">http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf</a></p>

<p><i>&quot;When integers are divided, the result of the / operator is the algebraic quotient with any fractional part discarded. If the quotient <code>&lt;a/b</code></i> is representable, the expression <code>&lt;(a/b)*b + a%b</code>&gt; shall equal a.&quot;&gt;</p>

<p>Perl does not obey this, only with use integer.</p>

<pre><code>    use integer; my ($a,$b)=(13,-4); print int(($a/$b)*$b) + $a % $b =&gt; 13
    my ($a,$b)=(13,-4); print int(($a/$b)*$b) + $a % $b =&gt; 10</code></pre>

<p>We found only once place in a module using constant negative integers with %. It is a core module, and is therefore fixed. Testing many other CPAN modules found no further problems, but watch out our distroprefs repo for future patches.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> This is a bad perl5 design change and a side-effect from using type-promotion before constant folding. cperl uses proper type dispatch and with both integer arguments it promotes the <code>modulo</code> op to <code>i_modulo</code>, which behaves differently (or &quot;normally&quot;). The perl5 constant folder should do the same, but does not currently. Using extra logic to prevent from using the libc implementation also makes perl5 <code>&quot;%&quot;</code> operator slower.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="compile-time-constant-folding-overflows-with-integer-literals">compile-time constant folding overflows with integer literals</dt>
<dd>

<p>Operations with only literal integers will not overflow to numbers, similar to perl5 with use integer. Only <code>&quot;+&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;*&quot;</code> will try to use UV (an unsigned value) as result, but not NV (an inexact number). All other ops besides divide and shift return IV (signed integers). Note that even comparison operators are integerized.</p>

<pre><code>    my $iv_min = -(~0 &gt;&gt; 1) - 1;   # ok
    my $iv_min_1 = -(~0 &gt;&gt; 1) - 2; # BUT this overflows
    =&gt;
    my $iv_min_1 = -(~0 &gt;&gt; 1) - 2.0; # avoid overflow

    my int $z = 4 / 5; # =&gt; number 0.8, violating the type checker
    # but!
    $z == 0; # =&gt; TRUE, because lexical int == const int uses i_eq,
             # the integer variant, which integerizes $z to 0</code></pre>

<p>All coretests pass, no tests had to be changed. In practice only compile-time constants in the negative IV_MIN to UV_MIN range will need to be fixed.</p>

<p><b>Rationale:</b> This was the original issue 2002 which disabled automatic integerization of all arithmetic ops with constants. <code>&quot;+&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;*&quot;</code> are a good exceptions to allow unsigned results (with the new <code>u_add</code> and <code>u_multiply</code> ops) to create large constants, but all other integer operations need to be preciser when inexact numbers are demanded, and return signed integers.</p>

<p><b>Exceptions</b>, keeping the old behaviour: Division for two integer constants is an internal exception and is not promoted to use integer division. <code>2/5 =&gt; 0.4</code> Compile-time shift operations return unsigned integers.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="Fix-breakage-and-bad-design">Fix breakage and bad design</h1>

<h2 id="signatures">signatures</h2>

<p>The p5p signature implementions is still lacking many important features and is twice as slow as doing without, and twice as slow as the cperl implementation which uses the stack variables directly without copying them to <code>@_</code>. There is no point in using it. It is the biggest cause for backwards incompatible changes, but it is marked as experimental, so the perl5 implementation can eventually be improved, and our changes are technically not incompatible.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="Add-optional-types-in-signatures">Add optional types in signatures</dt>
<dd>

<pre><code>    sub (int $i)   # as in Perl6, or
    sub ($i: int)  # as in the other gradual typed languages</code></pre>

<p>We use the samed syntax as provided for lexical variable declarations. In both variants, in leading position as with <code>my int $a;</code> and as attribute, as with <code>($i :int :const)</code></p>

<p>We need to seperate coretypes (int, uint, str, num) and user-defined types (existing class names), and the 2 core attributes <code>:const</code> and <code>:unsigned</code>. For more perl6 like traits see below.</p>

<p>Follow the same rules as in lexical declarations. The type must exist already as package, otherwise a syntax error is thrown.</p>

<pre><code>    $ cperl -e&#39;sub x(x $x){}&#39;
    No such class x at -e line 1, near &quot;sub x(x&quot;

    $ cperl -e&#39;sub x(str $s){}&#39;          # coretypes implicitly loaded

    $ cperl -e&#39;%Str::; sub x(Str $s){}&#39;  # user-defined type Str</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Add-subroutine-return-types">Add subroutine return types</dt>
<dd>

<p>For easier implementation we support subattributes, <code>:&lt;type&gt;</code> only, not the other possible syntax variants <code>=&gt; type</code> or <code>returns type</code>.</p>

<p>There are just a few semantic conflicts. Note that we can use the builtin attributes <code>:lvalue</code>, <code>:method</code>, <code>:const</code> and <code>:unsigned</code> also here.</p>

<p><code>:const</code> does not mean constant result, it rather means constant subroutine. Having this constant means that the compiler is able to inline it without run-time checks if it has changed.</p>

<p><code>:unsigned</code> as coretype or not? As sub attribute it could mean strictly typed to a return result of <code>UV</code>, like <code>:int :unsigned</code>, where the <code>:int</code> is optional. <code>:-unsigned</code> would mean <code>:int</code> then, return a signed int. <code>:unsigned</code> could also be no coretype, just a hint for <code>:int</code>, and without <code>:int</code> it will just be an attribute, not a strictly checked coretype. This decision is still open.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Add-call-by-ref-via-arg">Add call by-ref via \$arg</dt>
<dd>

<p>Support scalar lvalue references - sub (\$var)</p>

<p>With perl5 upstream all arguments are copied only, as with <code>my $arg1 = shift;</code> but alternate syntax for fast <code>$_[0]</code> access is not provided. So they have to keep the otherwise unneeded <code>@_</code> array around.</p>

<p>cperl uses <code>\$name</code> to denote references to scalar lvalues, which change the calling variable. e.g. <code>sub myfunc(int \$i) : int { $i++; }</code></p>

<p>For now scalar lvalue references only, <code>\@a</code> or <code>\%h</code> would be nice with type checks for arrayref or hashref. maybe <code>\[$]</code> also.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Improve-_-handling">Improve <code>@_</code> handling</dt>
<dd>

<p>Remove <code>@_</code> when not needed. Use the mark stack as in the ops.</p>

<p>With cperl <code>@_</code> will only hold the <code>&amp;rest</code> args, the undeclared rest if no other slurpy args are declared. i.e. <code>@_</code> will be empty when signatures are declared with a slurpy ending <code>@</code> or <code>%</code> arg, and <code>@_</code> is not referenced in the immediate function body, visible to the compiler, i.e. not hidden by a string eval.</p>

<p>We want to use the mark stack for signature calls, same as with OPS, we don&#39;t need to copy to @_.</p>

<p>Internally the elements of <code>@_</code> are currently accessed via aelem, not aelemfast. But this is moot with the introduction of the new OP_SIGNATURE op, which is even faster.</p>

<p>With the old 5.18-5.22 implementation the perl5 arity check is overly big and needs two checks and big strings with fixed arity subs.</p>

<pre><code>    perl -MO=Deparse -e&#39;sub x($a){$a++}&#39;
    sub x {
        die sprintf(&quot;Too many arguments for subroutine at %s line %d.\n&quot;,
          (caller)[1, 2]) unless @_ &lt;= 1;
        die sprintf(&quot;Too few arguments for subroutine at %s line %d.\n&quot;,
          (caller)[1, 2]) unless @_ &gt;= 1;
        my $a = $_[0];
        ();
        $a++;
    }</code></pre>

<p>cperl changes all arity errors to &quot;Wrong number arguments&quot;.</p>

<pre><code>    cperl -MO=Deparse -e&#39;sub x($a){$a++}&#39;
    sub x {
        die sprintf(&quot;Wrong number arguments for subroutine %s at %s line %d.\n&quot;,
          (caller(0))[3, 1, 2]) if @_ != 1;
        my $a = $_[0];
        ();
        $a++;
    }

    cperl -MO=Deparse -e&#39;sub x(\$a){$a++}&#39;
    sub x {
        die sprintf(&quot;Wrong number arguments for subroutine %s at %s line %d.\n&quot;,
          (caller(0))[3, 1, 2]) if @_ != 1;
        $_[0]++;
    }</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Support-default-self-invocant-with-methods-NY">Support default $self invocant with methods (NY)</dt>
<dd>

<p>If a method is declared as such (via <code>method</code> or <code>sub :method</code>) the <code>$self</code> argument is used as default invocant argument name, which can be overridden via the <code>($class: $args,...)</code> colon syntax.</p>

<pre><code>    sub adder ($a) :method { $self-&gt;{add} + $a; }</code></pre>

</dd>
<dt id="Add-:pure-attribute-for-subroutines">Add :pure attribute for subroutines</dt>
<dd>

<p>You can flag a function as purely functional, without any side-effects, to allow further compiler optimizations. Note that pure functions may throw, but may not access globals or do IO.</p>

<p>A pure function only reacts to its input arguments and will always return the same value with the same arguments, thus can be safely memoized or constant-folded or inlined without having to embed them into ENTER/LEAVE blocks.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Improved-error-reporting">Improved error reporting</dt>
<dd>

<p>In violations do not only print the position, also the declaration which is violated. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>    @a=(); sub x(\@b) {$b-&gt;[0]++} print x(\$a)</code></pre>

<p><code>Type of arg 1 to main::x must be arrayref (not a scalar ref) at -e line 1, near &quot;\$a)&quot;</code></p>

<p><code>=&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>Type of arg 1 \@b to main::x must be arrayref (not a scalar ref) at -e line 1, near &quot;\$a)&quot;</code></p>

<p>Proper signature types are not only a great help for catching errors early or improve documentation. They are performance critical, see coffescript, dart, microsoft typescript, google soundscript, facebook hack, mypy, ruby 3.0 and partially even perl6. The type inferencer will not be able to infer many types without explicit types. But with typed signatures, besides the obvious solution of private methods or closed classes we can inline most small methods, ignore run-time magic and improve most loops and array accesses. It is also critical to implement multi methods (compile-time optimized generics) and implement an advanced object system.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Support-...-for-efficient-varargs-passing">Support <code>...</code> for efficient varargs passing</dt>
<dd>

<p><code>...</code> as empty function body already has a special meaning as <b>yadayada</b> operator, just croaking, but interestingly not the usual meaning of varargs.</p>

<p>cperl uses <code>...</code> in the natural way to denote unnamed and uncopied rest args, and passes the varargs through to the next call.</p>

<p><code>...</code> denotes a slurpy unnamed signature, and <code>...</code> in a otherwise non-empy function body denotes passing those arguments efficiently to the next function. Internally <code>...</code> does not need to copy the values into a temporay array, we just need to pass the argument stack position down to the next calls using <code>...</code>. By using <code>...</code> instead of <code>@_</code> we can avoid copying the values to <code>@_</code>, we only need the stack index, not all the values.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-my-_-handling">Fix my $_ handling</h2>

<p>Perl5 had long-standing problems with lexical <code>$_</code> since the introduction of the SASSIGN optimization via OA_TARGLEX and OPpTARGET_MY in 2002.</p>

<p>cperl fixed this (it was using a wrong bit-testing, using AND as OR) and work is ongoing to harmonize further internal code exceptions and code-smell, e.g. SASSIGN and the match functions.</p>

<h2 id="Undo-B-bootstrap-breakage">Undo B bootstrap breakage</h2>

<p><a>B</a> was changed to support <code>use strict</code> from the very beginning, which broke the <a>B::Bytecode</a> compiler performance advantage, adding all compiler internal constants to the emitted bytecode. Reverting this breakage was denied because this developer did not understand the code. It is too bothersome in the long run to maintain our reversion of this breakage. It easier to check for <i>usecperl</i> in the compiler to be able to compile to bytecode properly again.</p>

<h2 id="Undo-constant-folding-i_opt-de-optimization">Undo constant folding i_opt de-optimization</h2>

<p>Automatic integer optimizations for constants were removed from constant folding against community consent in the early times with commit <code>e7311069</code>.</p>

<p>We re-add this optimization to treat constant integers and typed lexicals as such (as via an implicit use integer) in constant foldable expressions. I.e. integer overflow in constant expressions is only checked at compile-time, not run-time.</p>

<p>We re-instate the two special cases for I_DIVIDE and I_MODULO, which deviate from the untyped generic variants. div int / int returns a float even with constants, and mod with negative integers uses the standard C variant only if typed or within use integer. The untyped variant uses the perl5 definition of modulo as in group theory, which violates the definition of a remainder.</p>

<pre><code>    my int $i = -3; $i % 2 =&gt; -1, not 1.
    -3 % 2 =&gt; -1, not 1.
    1/2 =&gt; 0.5 (unchanged)</code></pre>

<p>We are also now able to do constant-folding on subroutine bodies, to either inline the body into the caller or replace the body with a constant in the general case. (i.e. without the <code>()</code> prototype)</p>

<h2 id="Undo-support-for-binary-names-NY-maybe">Undo support for binary names (NY, maybe)</h2>

<p>By announcing unicode support for names p5p silently allowed <code>\0</code> inside names, which they called an advantage by supporting now binary safe names. In reality unicode names were already supported since 5.8.4 and the whole 5.16 unicode name theatre was only about binary names. They didn&#39;t support binary names in all other code parts which had to deal with names, and thus enabled a huge attack vector to hide arbitrary user strings behind <code>\0</code> names, which was silently stripped before and when used in syscalls. They moved resonsibility to the user, as previously for input strings only, now also for input names, e.g. for package names which search the filesystem directly without sanitation or proper checks.</p>

<p>We have to keep the new GV API - accepting the string length - but even without <code>strict names</code> we strip everything behind the <code>\0</code> as before 5.16.</p>

<p>For a more efficient dynamic namespace implementation we might be switching from chained hash tables to a single ternary trie, radix tree or DAFSA, without support for <code>\0</code> and maybe even without support for unicode names.</p>

<h2 id="Warn-on-0shellcode-attempts-for-names-NY">Warn on \0shellcode attempts for names (NY)</h2>

<p>Make our <code>use warnings &quot;syscalls&quot;</code> the default.</p>

<p>Any attempt to attack package names with shellcode behing <code>\0</code> is being warned per default, and not only optionally with <code>use warnings &quot;syscalls&quot;</code>. There is no uninnocent or wrong usage of such names, only malicious intent, and this must appear in logfiles. This is worse than syntax errors and syntax errors are warned by default. p5p was vehemently against this change.</p>

<h2 id="strict-names-NY">strict names (NY)</h2>

<p>With <code>use strict &quot;names&quot;</code> we do not accept unparsable symbols created from strings. This is a new run-time error for use strict.</p>

<p>There&#39;s currently no room for an explicit <code>use strict &#39;names&#39;</code> hint due to a bad strict implementation. But later when we freed some <code>PL_hint</code> bits to hold strict defaults we can add support for that.</p>

<h2 id="TR39-confusable-names-NY">TR39 confusable names (NY)</h2>

<p>Reject confusables as described in TR39. Theoretically this can be added with <a href="#strict-names">&quot;strict names&quot;</a> only, but since this is only dangerous since v5.16 we can just throw a syntax error by default as in other languages with proper unicode support. (<i>Java</i>)</p>

<p>The compiler had to add this warning since 5.16:</p>

<p><i>Perl handling of new unicode identifiers - package and symbol names -</i> <i>without proper TR39 handling is considered a security risc and is not fully supported.</i> <i>See</i> <a href="http://websec.github.io/unicode-security-guide/">http://websec.github.io/unicode-security-guide/</a>.</p>

<p><i>Check your code for syntax spoofs, confusables, strip \0 from package names</i> <i>and enable use warnings &#39;syscalls&#39;</i>.</p>

<h2 id="Undo-the-double-readonly-system">Undo the double readonly system</h2>

<p>In order to support Hash unlock code, i.e. undoing readonly setting of hash values, p5p added a second readonly bit <code>SVf_PROTECT</code> for special values which are not allowed to be writable, even if the better solution to check for this special values at Hash unlock would have been trivial. It does not need to take away the last free SV bit, which we used to implement coretype checks on pad values, and unlock really only needs to unlock the previously locked values, not make all values unconditionally writable, thus making previously readonly values writable. <code>SVf_PROTECT</code> does not help with that.</p>

<p><code>SVf_PROTECT</code> is now the same as <code>SVf_READONLY</code>, and special checks were added for the two usecases when the readonly bit is unset. We need the <code>SVf_PROTECT</code> bit to mark native SV&#39;s in pad&#39;s, and even reserved it in 2012.</p>

<h2 id="Fix-the-hashes-NY">Fix the hashes (NY)</h2>

<p>Provide proper hash table abstractions. We don&#39;t need 5 times the same bad code copied along for all different kind of HEK (hash key) types.</p>

<p>Do not check the hash key for collisions with 4 different comparisons in the hot hash loop, use one instead.</p>

<p>For the old hash tables use the new default strategy PERL_PERTURB_KEYS_TOP to move each found bucket to the top of the chain.</p>

<p>Use fast hash functions, not secure slow ones. We get security by fixing the algorithmic problem, not by obscuring the users and fellow developers. We properly analyzed many hash functions and hash tables, for security and speed. The fastest, FNV1a, was the one the fellow developer schmorp choose <i>by his guts</i> in his stableperl fork.</p>

<p>Provide a Configure argument to define the hash function: -Dhash_func=FNV1A</p>

<p>Make the load factor definable, and change the default from 100% to 90%, which was tested as superior.</p>

<p><b>Further plans:</b></p>

<p>Hash functions need to be implemented as macros, not functions, undo that. (<i>maybe</i>)</p>

<p>Use cache-friendly open addressing, not simple, slow and DOS&#39;able (i.e. insecure) linked lists. Fix the &quot;security issues&quot;, i.e. denial of service issues properly.</p>

<p>Seperate the keys from the values to fit the search into a cache line.</p>

<p>Provide a special <code>:const</code> hash table type to enable optimizations to perfect hashes. With <code>study %hash</code> you can do the similar costly optimizations on non-const hashes to allow faster key access.</p>

<h2 id="Compile-time-attribute-hooks">Compile-time attribute hooks</h2>

<p><code>CHECK_SCALAR_ATTRIBUTES</code> (for <code>:const</code>, <code>:int</code>, <code>:num</code>, <code>:str</code>) This is basically a read-only <code>MODIFY_*_ATTRIBUTES</code> hook at compile-time with a better name to disassociate from the run-time check of <code>FETCH_*_ATTRIBUTES</code> with <code>my</code> lexicals. See also <a href="#Rewrite-critical-core-modules-in-C-as-builtins">&quot;Rewrite critical core modules in C as builtins&quot;</a> below.</p>

<h2 id="coretypes:-Int-UInt-Num-Str">coretypes: Int, UInt, Num, Str</h2>

<p>coretypes can only be built-in. Provide the 4 basic ones, and the combinations with <code>Undef</code>. Type combination are done via <code>@ISA</code>, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>    class ?Int :const { our @ISA :const = qw(Int Undef); }</code></pre>

<p>Our coretypes classes and its members are readonly. Provide fast ops variants for these types to omit type checks and magic calls at run-time. Scalars declared as <code>Int</code>, <code>Uint</code>, <code>Num</code>, <code>Str</code> cannot hold magic associations, such as <code>tie</code>.</p>

<p>We also enabled the <code>:const</code> attribute for all data: scalar, arrays, hash, functions, packages+classes.</p>

<p>At compile-time most UNOP&#39;s and BINOP&#39;s are promoted from the generic ops to more specific typed ops, similar to <code>use integer</code>. But use integer does not know the types of the variables at compile-time, many ops are only dispatched at run-time. See e.g. <a href="#negative-integer-modulo">&quot;negative integer modulo&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="/pod/perltypes.html#coretypes">&quot;coretypes&quot; in perltypes</a> and <a href="/pod/perldata.html#Constant-and-typed-lexical-variables">&quot;Constant and typed lexical variables&quot; in perldata</a>.</p>

<h2 id="native-unboxed-types:-int-uint-num-str-NY">native unboxed types: int, uint, num, str (NY)</h2>

<p>Internally the types for all scalar SV&#39;s always start with uppercase classnames, same as with most user-defined classes. The four lower-case variants <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>num</code>, <code>str</code> denote possible optimizations to direct unboxed values on the stack, which are not reference counted, and cannot yet be used across function calls. They are only safe to use within certain op sequences, and those optimizations are done automatically.</p>

<p>Unlike all other types native types are only hints, not promises. The compiler promotes data and code to native types only if its sees fit.</p>

<p>With PERL_NATIVE_TYPES enabled, most literal constants are stored as native types, native type declarations are a promise not a hint, and the optimizations involves up- and downgrading of data and ops in possible native chains. This leads to much tighter native expressions, with performance and memory gains. (3x less memory, ~3x faster).</p>

<p>For the builtin FFI we will also provide FFI-specific native types, like int32, int64, uint32, uint64 and ptr.</p>

<p>See <a href="/pod/perltypes.html#native-types">&quot;native types&quot; in perltypes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="types">types</h2>

<p>Provide a compile-time type inferencer, type checker and type optimizer. The inferencer runs automatically and can currently only infer <code>int</code> on array indices, ranges and <code>str</code> on hash keys, but has to give up on magic, dualvars, and <code>no strict &#39;refs&#39;</code>. With the help of declarations and type checks, as e.g. in <code>smartmatch</code> or <code>given</code>/<code>when</code> with type support it can infer much more.</p>

<pre><code>    if (type $a == &quot;int&quot;) {  =&gt; $a is an int in this scope }
    $str =~ /(\d+)/; =&gt; $1 is a typed Int</code></pre>

<p>Compile-time type checks need to be enabled with <code>use types;</code> though.</p>

<p>Typed signatures are backwards incompatible to perl5, as the trivial 4 line changes are still not yet supported upstream. The performance win is ~2-10x faster, you get compile-time type warnings, a business friendly coding environment and the possibility to display and put infered types automatically in your code, with a cooperating editor. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>    my $n=1000;
    for (my $i=0; $i&lt;$n; $i++) { }
=&gt;
    my int $n :const = 1000;
    for (my int $i=0; $i&lt;$n; $i++) { }</code></pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: When in doubt leave out types. If the inferer cannot find it, it might not be worth the trouble. But for hot code and to be precise always use types, as compile-time types prevent from costly run-time checks for types and magic hooks.</p>

<p><b>Builtin types</b> are the coretypes Int, Num, Str, UInt, ?Int, ?Num, ?Str and for builtin op-dispatch: Void int uint num str Int UInt Num Str Bool Numeric Scalar Ref Sub Array Hash List Any, with a <code>?</code> prefix denoting <code>| Undef</code> <i>&quot;or undef&quot;</i>, a <code>?</code> suffix optional, and for aggregate types using <code>()</code> brackets, like <code>:Array(:Int)</code>.</p>

<p><b>Status</b>: User code in pure perl or XS is currently not typed-checked nor inferred, only internal ops. Wrong type declarations still lead to type violation errors.</p>

<h2 id="const-for-all">:const for all</h2>

<p>Our <code>:const</code> attribute applies to all data types: scalar, arrays, hash, functions, packages + classes. <code>:const</code> hashes should of course be perfect, i.e. optimized to constant-time lookup, eliminating hash collisions.</p>

<p>See <a href="/pod/perltypes.html#const">&quot;:const&quot; in perltypes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Compile-time-optimizations">Compile-time optimizations</h2>

<p>cperl adds many more traditional compile-time optimizations: more and earlier constant folding, type promotions, shaped arrays, usage of literal and typed constants, loop unrolling, omit unnecessary array bounds checks, function inlining and conversion of static method calls to functions.</p>

<p>Perl 5 only inlines constant function bodies with an explicit empty <code>()</code> prototype.</p>

<pre><code>    sub x() {1+2} # inlined in perl5
    sub x   {1+2} # inlined in cperl only</code></pre>

<p>cperl inlines constant function bodies even without empty prototype declaration, has type declarations for most internal ops, and optimizes these ops depending on the argument types; currently for all arithmetic unops and binops, and the data-accessing ops padsv, svop, and sassign. <i>opnames.h</i> stores <code>PL_op_type_variants</code>, all possible type promotions for each op. <i>opcode.h</i> stores <code>PL_op_type</code> with the type declarations of all ops.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Small non-constant bodies may be inlined automatically, with the args replaced in the body. constants args and literals are replaced as is, also args as simple rvalues. lvalue args are checked for call-by-ref or call-by-value semantics, and use the arg either directly or as copy.</p>

<p>With shaped arrays and it&#39;s new unchecked <code>aelem_u</code> variants, loop bodies are optimized when the upper loop bound is declared via <code>$#</code>, the <i>arylen</i>.</p>

<pre><code>    for (0..$#array) {  .. $array[$_] .. }</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>$array[$_]</code> call does no bounds check of the index, since <code>$#array</code> is the last valid index, and we do not shrink the array in the loop, even if the array is not explicitly declared as shaped array.</p>

<p>Work is ongoing in loop unrolling, function inlining and speculative method inlining, which should speed up run-time performance dramatically and enable new optimizations, which were previously stopped on each function call border. Planned is also polymorphic inline caching with a usage counter, not just naive monomorphic inline cache for method calls.</p>

<p>Check the new DEBUGGING option <code>-Dk</code> which lists all optimizations and checks at compile-time, optionally verbose together with <code>-Dkv</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Static-method-calls">Static method calls</h3>

<pre><code>    strict-&gt;import(...)
    =&gt; strict::import(&quot;strict&quot;, ...)</code></pre>

<p>When the method is defined directly in the package, it is not possible to inject another package at run-time into the method search, thus the method call is optimized to a normal functions call.</p>

<h2 id="Typed-and-shaped-arrays">Typed and shaped arrays</h2>

<p>Enable faster array access, uniformly typed array values, use less memory (cache friendly), help the type system. See <a href="/pod/perltypes.html">perltypes</a>.</p>

<p>Type arrays specify the uniform type of the values. Typed arrays with native types use much less memory and provide faster direct access.</p>

<p>Shaped arrays define a compile-time constant &quot;shape&quot;, the size, which cannot be changed. All values are pre-initialized.</p>

<pre><code>  my int @a[20];         # or
  my @a[20] :int;</code></pre>

<p>With known indices the compiler can omit bounds checks on array accesses.</p>

<pre><code>    my int @a[5];
    for (0..$#a) { $a[$_] ... }</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>$a[$_]</code> uses the unchecked aelem_u operator, because the index <code>$_</code> cannot be out of bounds.</p>

<p>Shaped arrays are pre-initialized according to its type and cannot change the size. Attempts are caught at compile-time or run-time. With constant or type-checked indices in range the access op is optimized to omit the bounds check, via unchecked aelem variants. Negative constant indices are converted to positive at compile-time.</p>

<h2 id="Typed-and-shaped-hashes-NY">Typed and shaped hashes (NY)</h2>

<pre><code>  my int %h;             # or
  my str %a;             # hash with str values only
  my int %a{20};         # hash with int values only. fixed hash size,
                         # no grow on insertion.
  my str %a{20} :const   # fixed hash size, no grow on insertion,
                         # perfect hash (keys may not change, values do).
     = (...);</code></pre>

<p>No sparse arrays (i.e. hash with int keys) yet. but this would need a different declaration syntax if to be supported natively. e.g. <code>my int %a{int};</code> - sparse array with int keys and int values. or <code>my %a : hash(int);</code> variant 2: <code>my IntSparseHash %a</code>, which can go with a user class and methods, but this will be slow, without native ops.</p>

<h2 id="Inlined-functions-NY">Inlined functions (NY)</h2>

<p>If a function body is inlinable, i.e. simple, with no control ops like return, goto caller, warn, die, reset, runcv, padrange, adds no seperate lexicals and has less than 10 ops, they are inlined. Static methods are converted to functions before and then possibly inlined.</p>

<h2 id="Rewrite-critical-core-modules-in-C-as-builtins">Rewrite critical core modules in C as builtins</h2>

<p>Builtins: <code>strict</code>, <code>Carp</code>, <code>attributes</code>, <code>DynaLoader</code>, <code>XSLoader</code>, <code>Exporter</code>.</p>

<p>As shared lib: <code>warnings</code>, <code>Config</code> and <i>unicode folding tables</i> to save memory, startup time and reduce bloat.</p>

<p>Big constant hashes and tables need to be in a shared memory segment, not recompiled for every fork or thread, similar to the <a>Encode</a> tables, which are implemented properly. The risc to introduce even more performance regressions by keeping some critical core modules as <i>.pm</i> is too high and broke the compiler too often. Most developers have no idea of the impact of innocently looking additions.</p>

<p>We need to reduce memory, and want to reduce the size of compiled code by 30%, but in some cases it will be 200%. As builtin or shared library we go to zero startup-time overhead for those modules. With compiled Config alone the memory savings are down to 5.6 levels.</p>

<h3 id="strict-1.10c-as-builtin">strict 1.10c as builtin</h3>

<p>Starting with cperl (based on Perl 5.22) <a>strict</a> is now a builtin module, implemented as XS functions which are always available.</p>

<p><b>Changes:</b></p>

<p><i>strict.pm</i> is only provided for documentation, <code>$INC{&#39;strict.pm&#39;} = &#39;xsutils.c&#39;</code> With a list of wrong tags only the wrong tags are reportyed one-by-one, and not together. All other functionality stays the same.</p>

<h3 id="attributes-0.26_01c-as-builtin">attributes 0.26_01c as builtin</h3>

<p>Starting with cperl (based on Perl 5.22) <a>attributes</a> is now again a builtin XS module. There&#39;s no need to dynaload it at parse time.</p>

<p><i>attributes.pm</i> moved back to <i>lib/attributes.pm</i> and is only provided for documentation and import.</p>

<p><code>CHECK_<i>type</i>_ATTRIBUTES</code> is a new compile-time hook, like a readonly variant of <code>MODIFY_<i>type</i>_ATTRIBUTES</code>, or the compile-time variant of <code>FETCH_<i>type</i>_ATTRIBUTES</code>.</p>

<p>There are several new builtin attributes:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="const-for-all-types">:const for all types</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="unsigned-for-all-integer-types-sets-SvIsUV_on-off">:unsigned for all integer types, sets SvIsUV_on|off</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="existing-classes-as-types-are-recognized">existing classes as types are recognized</dt>
<dd>

<p>and stored for lexical types and subroutine return types.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="DynaLoader-2.00c-and-XSLoader-as-builtins">DynaLoader 2.00c and XSLoader as builtins</h3>

<p>Starting with cperl (based on Perl 5.22) <a>DynaLoader</a> and XSLoader have no perl code anymore, <i>DynaLoader.pm</i> was rewritten as <i>dlboot.c</i>.</p>

<p><b>Changes</b>:</p>

<p><code>@dl_library_path</code> eliminates now all duplicate paths and resolves symlinks of <code>$Config{libpth}</code> at build time.</p>

<p>Only the <code>$ENV{PERL_BUILD_EXPAND_CONFIG_VARS}</code> settings are implemented. All Config settings are compiled in at build time, run-time changes are not honored. Config is now also a compiled module, <i>Config_heavy.pl</i> is gone, and its hash was always readonly, so there&#39;s no way to change Config values at run-time without recompiling it.</p>

<p>Not sure yet about keeping support for <i>.bs</i> hooks and <code>@dl_resolve_using</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>XSLoader::load_file($module, $modlibname, ...)</code> function is new, <a>XSLoader</a> is a builtin also. <code>...</code> is passed to the loaded XS function as with <code>XSLoader::load($module, ...)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="warnings-as-XS-extension-NY">warnings as XS extension (NY)</h3>

<p>It is compiled as shared library, the builtin categories are implemented as perfect hash, and extended with a normal perl hash. Some internal variables are not accessible anymore, the API is via the documented functions.</p>

<p><b>Status:</b> 1 scope bug with Carp. Not yet enabled.</p>

<h3 id="Config-as-XS-extension">Config as XS extension</h3>

<p>It is compiled as shared library, with all keys as readonly perfect hash. Some internal variables are not accessible anymore, the API is via the documented functions.</p>

<h1 id="Plans-for-further-core-features">Plans for further core features</h1>

<h2 id="Lexical-methods">Lexical methods</h2>

<p>Lexical methods are of course <b>private</b> to its enclosing class, i.e. not visable from outside the class. And they are also <b>closed</b> (or also called <i>sealed</i> or <i>final</i>) as planned by Damian Conway, i.e. they cannot be changed later. This enables the compiler to inline them automatically when its worthwhile. e.g. when they are small enough. They are either defined in the new style: <code>class .. { my method .. }</code> or old style: <code>package .. { my sub .. }</code></p>

<h3 id="Carp-2.00c-as-builtin">Carp 2.00c as builtin</h3>

<p><a>Carp</a> might be a implemented as builtin XS module. There&#39;s no need to require it. <i>Carp.pm</i> is only provided for documentation, <code>$INC{&#39;Carp.pm&#39;} = &#39;xsutils.c&#39;</code> Many carp function are added to the perl5 API and available to core and extensions.</p>

<p><b>Changes</b>:</p>

<p>Currently shortmess is only simplified, the step to skip packages which trust each other (via <code>@CARP_NOT</code> or <code>@ISA</code>) is not yet implemented, neither is the <code>CARP_TRACE</code> formatting hook. The deprecated <code>$Carp::CarpLevel</code> variable is now ignored.</p>

<p>Other not yet implemented variables: <code>$Carp::MaxEvalLen</code>, <code>$Carp::MaxArgLen</code>, <code>$Carp::MaxArgNums</code>, <code>$Carp::RefArgFormatter</code></p>

<p><b>Note</b>:</p>

<p>This branch is currently not included. It&#39;s too instable to get the caller depth right from pure perl vs XS, and most extended hooks (format, CARP_TRACE, CARP_NOT) are not yet implemented. Note that XS calls usually do not get counted in caller, unless you use the SCOPE keyword.</p>

<h3 id="unicode-folding-tables-as-XS-extension">unicode folding tables as XS extension</h3>

<p>They are compiled as shared library, with all keys as readonly perfect hash. Some internal variables are not accessible anymore, the API is via the documented functions.</p>

<p>Maybe seperate them into a light folding table and heavy names and properties.</p>

<h2 id="Remove-Attribute::Handler-from-core">Remove Attribute::Handler from core</h2>

<p>This evals all attributes at compile-time. Discourage its usage.</p>

<h2 id="Add-the-compiler-back-to-core">Add the compiler back to core</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/B-C/">B::C</a> testsuite runs too long for cpan users, and it needs to be developed in sync to avoid typical 6 months wait-time after a core change. Maybe provide python-like precompiled <code>ByteCache</code> <i>.pmc</i> as default. You could pre-compile then modules with higher optimization levels, esp. the type inferencer.</p>

<p>Maybe include a <code>Data::Compile</code> module to dump only data without all the code to a shared library, and possibly <a href="https://github.com/rurban/Perfect-Hash">Perfect::Hash</a> and a new <i>ph.c</i> to create and optimize readonly hashes, which is needed for the shared XS hashes of Config, warnings and unicode tables.</p>

<h2 id="Backport-core-testsuite-fixes-for-the-compiler">Backport core testsuite fixes for the compiler</h2>

<p>Honor differences between compile-time und run-time, when run compiled. Other than a few wrong testcases, the compilers does pass the core testsuite.</p>

<h1 id="Longer-term-goals">Longer term goals</h1>

<h2 id="Faster-functions-calls">Faster functions calls</h2>

<p>Optionally omit caller, @_, freetmps, exception handler when possible, i.e. no string eval&#39;s are present in the body, the compiler can detect it or the right compiler hint is given.</p>

<h2 id="tailcall-optimization">tailcall optimization</h2>

<p>Detect tail positions and replace the call with a fast goto. This needs to be in core, not as external module.</p>

<h2 id="Proper-object-system">Proper object system</h2>

<p>No, not Moose, but close. Rather an optimizable perl6-like object system in core. Provide a simple MOP for reflection purposes, bot not for overrides, i.e. metaobjects for classes, proper class and method syntax, anonymous classes by pointer not name, proper multi dispatch with types, roles, class and method lookup by pointer, not by name. Create native optimized shapes via mixins as in p2 (an enhanced bless). Lexical methods are private, optimize dispatch for single inheritance. i.e the convenient class syntax extends on a single class only, classes are finalizable by the calling application.</p>

<p>Eventually prepare multi-dispatch and optimize for early-bound method calls with typed arguments and closed classes.</p>

<p>Dispatch is via C3, not the old depth-first left-to-right mro implementation.</p>

<p>For type inference we will need to make <code>new</code> a special keyword, which is a shortcut for <code>bless</code>, with a fixed classname. <code>bless</code> can use computed classnames and thus enforces dynamic types.</p>

<h2 id="libffi-in-core">libffi in core</h2>

<p>Declare extern functions and libraries and call them. There&#39;s no need for XS and seperate compilation for most bindings. Not everybody has a compiler, the very same compiler perl was compiled with. libffi is the slowest ffi library, but has the best platform support, as it is integrated with gcc for java jni support.</p>

<pre><code>   extern sub atoi(str $s):int;
   extern sub itoa(int $s):str;
   extern sub printf(str $s, ...):void;</code></pre>

<h2 id="Editor-integration">Editor integration</h2>

<p>With type inference we can provide a much nicer development environment, which also supports the debugger. <b>plsense</b> should give type feedback. I&#39;m thinking of a port of <b>ZeroBrane Studio</b> for perl. This means provide core support for the needed serializers and introspection facilities.</p>

<h2 id="Jit">Jit</h2>

<p>Add a jit for the easiest platforms, and provide dynamic javascript-based optimizations when stacks need to be replaced. Eventually even promote to bignum not double automatically, as in perl6. But this is optional, the next points are more important. Jit&#39;s are a bit overrated. a fast bytecode loop can easily beat a jit and optimizing compiler, see luajit2, <a href="http://www.emulators.com/docs/nx25_nostradamus.htm">http://www.emulators.com/docs/nx25_nostradamus.htm</a> or <a href="http://nominolo.blogspot.de/2012/07/implementing-fast-interpreters.html">http://nominolo.blogspot.de/2012/07/implementing-fast-interpreters.html</a></p>

<h2 id="Optimize-the-vm-the-runloop">Optimize the vm, the runloop</h2>

<p>We carry around way too much bloat in the ops and the data, which is not needed at run-time. e.g. the compiler throws away the nested symbol table stashes if not needed, which frees 20% memory. But think of a lua/p2-like redesign of tagged values and slimmer ops, and eventually put the stack onto the CPU stack.</p>

<p>Optimize special arithmetic op sequences to use unboxed integers and strings on the stack. We experiment in allowing unboxed values on the stack, because the stack is not garbage collected and not refcounted. We just need to be sure to box them before entering a non-collaborating sub, leaving a block with possible exceptions and stack cleanup. Those unboxed values are internally typed as <code>:int</code> and <code>:str</code>. Note that the coretypes <code>:int</code> and <code>:str</code> are not guaranteed to be unboxed, only if the compiler sees fit. In most cases those values are boxed but without a class pointer and magic attached. (Done in the native branch)</p>

<p>Maybe rewrite to a better register-based compiler with fixed-length 2 operands as in p2, but this might be too tricky for XS, mapping the global stack to the local stack. Probably no SSA (three arguments), just a cpu friendly two argument form as in p2/lua 5.1.</p>

<p>Allow faster XS calls, user-provided function calls and method calls. provide support for named arguments in the vm, fast not via hashes. Many of the current io+sys ops are better implemented as library methods. With ~50ops instead of &gt;300 the runloop might fit into the L1 cache again. Seperate calling of fixed arity methods from varargs. detect and use tailcalls automatically. Do not step into a seperate runloop for every single function call, only for coros, which do need to record the the stack information.</p>

<p>Run-time optimize the data, no 2x indirection to access hash and array structs. Provide forwarding pointers to single tuples to hold all. This could provide also the possibility for a GC if a second sweep for timely destruction is doable.</p>

<p>Optimize <b>HEK</b> for faster hash comparison, and use it for native str types, which might benefit from its immutability and the pre-calculated hash, len and utf8 fields.</p>

<p>Check readonly support for <code>PL_strtab</code> for the compiler. Builtin ro ph + dynamic as in warnings XS.</p>

<h2 id="Better-symbol-table">Better symbol table</h2>

<p>Check converting the GV stash tree of hashes into a single global data structure, not a nested hash of hashes: Hash, AVL tree, Trie (TST or R&sup2; TST), Patricia trie or DAFSA (Deterministic acyclic finite state automaton) for faster dynamic variable and function name lookup. No binary names, all as UTF8. Maybe restrict to ASCII or valid identifiers to limit the trie memory (array of 26 vs 256). Stashes point then to trie nodes and need a HV check. Optionally provide partial read-only support for the compiler, as for <code>PL_strtab</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Coro-support">Coro support</h2>

<p>Keep native threads asis (this is not fixable, better remove it), but actively help coroutine and async IO support.</p>

<h2 id="Untangle-the-IO-layer-mess">Untangle the IO layer mess</h2>

<p>A stack is a stack.</p>

<h2 id="Bring-back-proper-match-and-given-when">Bring back proper `match` and `given/when`</h2>

<p>With type support it would be even efficient and helps the inferencer. <code>match</code> needs to be structural, p5p <code>smartmatch</code> can stay dumb as it is now.</p>

<h2 id="clp">clp</h2>

<p>Possibly add a <b>clp</b> library, a constraint logic solver, with possible bindings to external sat solvers, like minisat, which can be included due to its small size and license. It is solved by checking for lvalue function calls in assignments, when the function is not declared as <code>:lvalue</code>.</p>

<pre><code>    use clp;
    sub fact(int $i=0) :int { assert $i&gt;=0; return $i ? fact($i-1) : 1 }
    say fact(7);     # =&gt; 5040
    fact($_) = 5040; # solve it!
    say $_;          # =&gt; 7</code></pre>

<h1 id="Development-policies">Development policies</h1>

<p>We track stable upstream releases for our releases only. The current stable release is based in 5.22.1. The previous stable release was 5.14.4, as 5.16 introduced critical instabilities which were not fixed mostly until 5.20 and 5.22, and 5.20 alone was not worth to update cperl to. The previous stable release was 5.8.9 and the one before was 5.6.2. So we do not know which will be the next stable cperl release. It could be 5.24, but usually it takes longer, so something like 5.30 sounds realistic. So far we have detected 2 grave API mistakes in 5.22.0. But we do merge all official p5p releases into our development branch monthly.</p>

<p>A true perl6-like object system is in work, but not yet enabled. It supports the perl6-like syntax for class, method, has, roles (mixins, compile-time composable classes), method modifiers (:before, :after, :around), multiple type dispatch (multi, no need to overload methods), finalizable classes (compile-time optimizations) and easier perl6-like syntax, which closely resembles <code>Moose</code> without its massive overhead.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no <b>MOP</b> (meta-object protocol), but reflection. There&#39;s no need to override the internal behavior of the object system, the dispatch, the class and role layout.</p>

<p>perl5 proper started being compiler unfriendly with 5.16, with changed security and string handling. It can be compiled but it is not recommended, as it features only about 5% memory savings. B::C can still strip the nested stashes (namespaces), but needs to keep all COW strings dynamic.</p>

<p>With cperl we can again compile to more efficient code, with &gt;35% memory savings.</p>
