<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perl5241cdelta - what is new for cperl v5.24.1</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes perl-only differences between the cperl 5.24.0 release and the cperl 5.24.1 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.3, first read <a href="/cperl/perl5240cdelta.html">perl5240cdelta</a>, which describes differences between 5.22.3 and 5.24.0.</p>

<h1 id="Notice">Notice</h1>

<p>perl5.24.1 upstream was a security update to non-existing problem. cperl added PERLIO_DEBUG as optional handle to redirect DEBUGGING outout via -Dx switches to. This is only usable with DEBUGGING perls, which are not used in production, only during development. perl5.24.1 changed PERLIO_DEBUG to only be active for PerlIO debugging together with <code>-Di</code>.</p>

<h1 id="Security">Security</h1>

<h2 id="n-buffer-overflows"><code>@{ \327 \n }</code> buffer overflows</h2>

<p>Fixed <code>@{ \327 \n }</code> tokenizer failures and heap buffer overflows in <code>sv_vcatpvfn_flags()</code> with wrong tracking of <code>PL_linestr</code>, the currently parsed line buffer. This can easily lead to security relevant exploits.</p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128951">[perl #128951]</a></p>

<h2 id="eval-q-.-chr-overlarge-stack-overflow"><code>eval &quot;q&quot; . chr(overlarge)</code> stack overflow</h2>

<p>In <code>eval &quot;q&quot; . chr(100000000064)</code> generating the error message <code>Can&#39;t find string terminator &quot;XXX&quot;&#39;</code> was overrunning a local buffer designed to hold a single utf8 char, since it wasn&#39;t allowing for the <code>\0</code> at the end.</p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128952">[perl #128952]</a></p>

<h2 id="Protect-and-warn-on-hash-flood-DoS">Protect and warn on hash flood DoS</h2>

<p>If the collisions for a hash key lookup exceeds 128 tries (i.e. a linear search in a linked list), this qualifies as a malicious hash DoS (<i>Denial of Service</i>) attack. Generally maximal 8 collisions appear in normal hash table usage. Every 8th such hash flood attack performs a <code>sleep(2)</code> to limit the impact.</p>

<p>This security scheme is much easier and faster than trying to hide the random hash seed with randomized iterators and collisions lists, which cperl doesn&#39;t use.</p>

<h2 id="Warn-on-metasploit-CVE-2015-1592">Warn on metasploit CVE-2015-1592</h2>

<p>Detection of the destructive attack against Movable-Type, the third vector only, which tries to delete <i>mt-config.cgi</i> was added to was added to <a href="/cperl/lib/Memoize/Storable.html">Storable</a> 3.01c.</p>

<p>Warns with &quot;SECURITY: Movable-Type CVE-2015-1592 Storable metasploit attack&quot; but does not protect against it.</p>

<h2 id="Warn-on-metasploit-reverse-shells">Warn on metasploit reverse shells</h2>

<p>Detect the metasploit payload unix/reverse_perl and some existing variants. This is just a dumb match at startup against existing exploits in the wild, but not future variants. Warns with &quot;SECURITY: metasploit reverse/bind shell payload&quot;, but do not protect against it. This warning is thrown even without <code>-w</code>.</p>

<p>Also detects the CVE-2012-1823 reverse/bind shell payload, which is widely exploited too. The security warning is called &quot;SECURITY: CVE-2012-1823 reverse/bind shell payload&quot;.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Out-of-bounds check elimination in loops has been fixed for lexical counters. E.g. with <code>my @a=(0..4); for my $i (0..$#a) { $a[$i] }</code> each access to <code>$a[$i]</code> in the loop is now really converted to the unchecked faster <b>aelem_u</b> op.</p>

<p>Note that multideref ops are not yet converted to omit out-of-bounds checks. This is only implemented since cperl-5.25 (released with 5.26.0c), since it needs to widen the internal mderef structure.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Improvements when reading from arrays have been imported from perl 5.25. <code>av_fetch()</code> uses less branches reading from the end (negative indices), and a branch checking for freed <code>@_</code> elements has been removed,</p>

</li>
<li><p>The new <code>strEQc</code>/<code>strNEc</code> macros are used instead of <code>strEQ(s,&quot;constant&quot;)</code>. This enables word-wise comparison via memcpy, in opposite of byte-wise comparisons via strcmp with already known sizes. This is a 10% performance improvement under most optimization levels.</p>

<p>Use more <code>strEQc</code>, <code>strNEc</code> macros, when safe to use, i.e. the left buffer is big enough, now with Address Sanitizer fallbacks.</p>

<p>The new fast buffer comparison macros <code>strEQc</code> and <code>strNEc</code> compare a full string including the final <code>\0</code>, <code>memEQc</code> and <code>memNEc</code> just the start of a buffer, with constants strings. Note that valgrind and Address Sanitizer will complain about out of range access of the left side of the buffer. To access these buffers however is safe and will not lead to SIGBUS on stricter platforms. To prevent valgrind from warning on this, you may want to define <code>-DVALGRIND</code>, which uses a safe and slower fallback macro.</p>

</li>
<li><p>aassign: pre-allocate needed hash size with aassign, similar to arrays, avoiding run-time hash splits. e.g. <code>my %h = (.. =</code> .., .. =&gt; ..)&gt;</p>

<p>This version is 30% faster overall in the Mail::SpamAssassin testsuite than cperl-5.24.0.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Pre-extend internal hashes and stashes to avoid unnecessary boot-time hash splits. <code>%warnings::</code>, <code>%Config::</code>, <code>%utf8::</code>, <code>%version::</code>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Diagnostics">Diagnostics</h1>

<p>The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see <a href="/cperl/perldiag.html">perldiag</a>.</p>

<h2 id="New-Diagnostics">New Diagnostics</h2>

<h3 id="New-Errors">New Errors</h3>

<ul>

<li><p>The <a href="/cperl/perldiag.html#Too-many-elements">Too many elements</a> error is now triggered when accessing or extending an out of bounds array index or trying to insert too many hash keys. This is to prevent from silent hash or array overflows. Previously extending a hash beyond it&#39;s capable size was silently ignored, leading to performance degradation with overly high fill factors and extending an array failed only on memory exhaustion, but the signed index led to an index overflow between I32 and U32, resp. I64 and U64.</p>

<p>Even worse, accessing overflown unsigned array indices would silently access the signed counterpart, indices at the end.</p>

<p>Note that the out of bound error message with shaped arrays is different. (cperl only)</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <a href="/cperl/perldiag.html#panic:-hash-key-too-long-u">Panic: hash key too long</a> error is now thrown with overlarge hash keys in every <code>hv_common</code> access and in <a href="/cperl/lib/Cpanel/JSON/XS.html">Cpanel::JSON::XS</a>. perl5 still silently ignores those failures, and truncates the keys. Many more similar <code>panic: (file|keyword|mro|stash)? name too long</code> errors were added to the parser and compiler to protect from overlong names (&gt; I32_MAX, 2147483647). (cperl only)</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="New-Warnings">New Warnings</h3>

<ul>

<li><p>The new security warning &quot;Hash flood&quot; was added. See <a href="#Protect-and-warn-on-hash-flood-DoS">&quot;Protect and warn on hash flood DoS&quot;</a>. (cperl only)</p>

</li>
<li><p>The new <code>security</code> warnings &quot;metasploit reverse/bind shell payload&quot; and &quot;CVE-2012-1823 reverse/bind shell payload&quot; were added, detecting the existing metasploit/libxploit and phpcgi CVE-2012-1823 reverse and bind shells. See <a href="#Warn-on-metasploit-reverse-shells">&quot;Warn on metasploit reverse shells&quot;</a> (cperl only)</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Configuration-and-Compilation">Configuration and Compilation</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Added <code>sanitize_address</code> config entry and probe, and matching <code>USE_SANITIZE_ADDRESS</code> <i>config.h</i> define. (cperl only)</p>

</li>
<li><p>Removed <code>i_netinet6_in6</code> Config entry and probe, and matching <code>I_NETINET6_I6</code> <i>config.h</i> define, which was a typo. This was added with cperl-5.22.2 and was never used due to the typo. It cannot be used due to RFC 2553. (cperl only)</p>

</li>
<li><p>Added <code>i_netinet_in_systm</code> probe. (cperl only)</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Testing">Testing</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><code>make minitest</code> has been vastly improved</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix tests for the optional <code>-DNODEFAULT_SHAREKEYS</code> configuration.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Add hash flood tests with pre-created collision data for 511 collisions on seed=0.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Split <i>t/op/tr.t</i> into unicode and ebcdic variant</p>

</li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t warn on missing Pod::Man in CORE tests. Pod::Man is not a dependency for EUMM, as it needs EUMM at first.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Internal-Changes">Internal Changes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Increasing the hash size to values larger then U32_MAX are now silently ignored. This only affects 64-bit platforms. Normally a hash split to an overlarge value should die, but historically it silently ignored the split, it just increases the fill rate and decreases performance.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Fixed several <b>heap-buffer-overflows</b> detected by asan: use-after-free in Dynaloader (ReadKey probe with -DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALAR), heap-overflow in gv_fetchfile (t/comp/parser.t), heap-overflow with signatures, heap-overflow in XSLoader, invalid memEQc in toke.c missing out on parsing #!perl -opts, B-C global-buffer-overflow with dynamic COW strings, wrong savepvn args.</p>

<p>There are still heap-use-after-free problems with perlcc and PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/207">[cperl #207]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed overwriting the <code>HVhek_UNSHARED</code> bit in the hash loop broken with v5.9.</p>

<p>This fixed <code>-DNODEFAULT_SHAREKEYS</code>. In the default configuration without NODEFAULT_SHAREKEYS since 5.003_001 all hash keys are stored twice, once in the hash and once again in <code>PL_strtab</code>, the global string table, with the benefit of faster hash loops and copies. Almost all hashtables get the SHAREKEYS bit. With <code>-Accflags=-DNODEFAULT_SHAREKEYS</code> simple scripts are 20-30% faster. <a href="https://github.com/perl11/cperl/issues/201">[cperl #201]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix HEK_TAINTED check for HEf_SVKEY values. A HEf_SVKEY hek has no tainted flag, the pointed to SV has. This is a cperl-only security feature.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Only clear LS_COLORS for glob</p>

<p>When miniperl calls csh to implement glob(), we cleared %ENV temporarily to avoid csh dying on invalid values for things like LS_COLORS. That has proven to have far too many problems, since many system-dependent env vars are necessary for calling an external process. See the <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126041">[perl #126041]</a> ticket for details.</p>

<p>A better solution is temporarily to clear only those vars that are known to be problematic and make csh possibly fail. There only hap- pens to be one of those at present, namely LS_COLORS.</p>

</li>
<li><p>A SEGV in mess_sv during global destruction with a DEBUGGING perl and -DS been fixed, occuring when we wanted to report the location of an error when curcop has already been freed.</p>

<p>Testcase: <code>./miniperl -DS -e &#39;$_=&quot;f&quot;; s/./&quot;&amp;&quot;.$&amp;/ee&#39;</code></p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=129027">[perl #129027]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>A SEGV in ck_shift with an empty/wrong current function, caused by a syntax error has been fixed. The syntax error is now reported lateron. Testcase: <code>&#39;qq{@{sub{q}}]]}}; s0{shift&#39;</code></p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=125351">[perl #125351]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Since Perl 5.20, line numbers have been off by one when perl is invoked with the <b>-x</b> switch. This has been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128508">[perl #128508]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Handle missing Unicode heredoc terminators correctly. E.g. <code>perl -CS -e &#39;use utf8; q&laquo;&#39;</code> prints now <code>Can&#39;t find string terminator &quot;&laquo;&quot; anywhere before EOF at -e line 1.</code></p>

<p><a href="https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128701">[perl #128701]</a></p>

</li>
<li><p>Mentioning a constant twice in a row does not lead to assertions errors with DEBUGGING builds, such as e.g. <code>sub ub(){0} ub ub</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed overwriting the HVhek_UNSHARED bit in the hash loop broken with v5.9.</p>

<p>This fixed <code>-DNODEFAULT_SHAREKEYS</code>. In the default configuration without NODEFAULT_SHAREKEYS since 5.003_001 all hash keys are stored twice, once in the hash and once again in <code>PL_strtab</code>, the global string table, with the benefit of faster hash loops and copies. Almost all hashtables get the SHAREKEYS bit. (#201)</p>

</li>
<li><p>Array and hash index overflow are now properly detected and throw an &quot;Too many elements&quot; error.</p>

<p>E.g. on 32bit <code>$ary[2147483648]</code> will lead to a compile-time error, <code>$i=2147483648; $ary[$i]</code> to a run-time error. Before 5.24c or with perl5 those two would silently overflow to <code>-1</code>, i.e. accessing the last element.</p>

<p>When inserting more than U32, i.e. 4294967295 hash elements, the same error is now thrown. Before 5.24c or with perl5 the element would have been inserted, with 32bit the hash table would not have been extended and the load factor would increase, the collisions and performance would decrease. On 64bit the hash table would have beed increased, but the elements would collide on the last element, leading to the same problems, just more dramatic.</p>

</li>
</ul>
