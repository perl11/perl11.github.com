<p>perl5252delta - what is new for perl v5.25.2</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.25.1 release and the 5.25.2 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.25.0, first read <a href="/cperl/perl5251delta.html">perl5251delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.25.0 and 5.25.1.</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<h2 id="Perl-can-now-do-default-collation-in-UTF-8-locales-on-platforms-that-support-it">Perl can now do default collation in UTF-8 locales on platforms that support it</h2>

<p>Some platforms natively do a reasonable job of collating and sorting in UTF-8 locales. Perl now works with those. For portability and full control, <a>Unicode::Collate</a> is still recommended, but now you may not need to do anything special to get good-enough results, depending on your application. See <a href="/cperl/perllocale.html#Category-LC_COLLATE:-Collation:-Text-Comparisons-and-Sorting">&quot;Category <code>LC_COLLATE</code>: Collation: Text Comparisons and Sorting&quot; in perllocale</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Better-locale-collation-of-strings-containing-embedded-NUL-characters">Better locale collation of strings containing embedded <code>NUL</code> characters</h2>

<p>In locales that have multi-level character weights, these are now ignored at the higher priority ones. There are still some gotchas in some strings, though. See <a href="/cperl/perllocale.html#Collation-of-strings-containing-embedded-NUL-characters">&quot;Collation of strings containing embedded <code>NUL</code> characters&quot; in perllocale</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Lexical-subroutines-are-no-longer-experimental">Lexical subroutines are no longer experimental</h2>

<p>Using the <code>lexical_subs</code> feature no longer emits a warning. Existing code that disables the <code>experimental::lexical_subs</code> warning category that the feature previously used will continue to work. The <code>lexical_subs</code> feature has no effect; all Perl code can use lexical subroutines, regardless of what feature declarations are in scope.</p>

<h2 id="CORE-subroutines-for-hash-and-array-functions-callable-via-reference"><code>CORE</code> subroutines for hash and array functions callable via reference</h2>

<p>The hash and array functions in the <code>CORE</code> namespace--<code>keys</code>, <code>each</code>, <code>values</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>unshift</code> and <code>splice</code>--, can now be called with ampersand syntax (<code>&amp;CORE::keys(\%hash</code>) and via reference (<code>my $k = \&amp;CORE::keys; $k-&gt;(\%hash)</code>). Previously they could only be used when inlined.</p>

<h1 id="Security">Security</h1>

<h2 id="Di-switch-is-now-required-for-PerlIO-debugging-output"><code>-Di</code> switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output</h2>

<p>Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file specified by the <code>PERLIO_DEBUG</code> environment variable if perl wasn&#39;t running setuid and the <code>-T</code> or <code>-t</code> switches hadn&#39;t been parsed yet.</p>

<p>If perl performed output at a point where it hadn&#39;t yet parsed its switches this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file named by <code>PERLIO_DEBUG</code> even when the <code>-T</code> switch had been supplied.</p>

<p>Perl now requires the <code>-Di</code> switch to produce PerlIO debugging output. By default this is written to <code>stderr</code>, but can optionally be redirected to a file by setting the <code>PERLIO_DEBUG</code> environment variable.</p>

<p>If perl is running setuid or the <code>-T</code> switch has supplied <code>PERLIO_DEBUG</code> is ignored and the debugging output is sent to <code>stderr</code> as for any other <code>-D</code> switch.</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<h2 id="keys-returned-from-an-lvalue-subroutine"><code>keys</code> returned from an lvalue subroutine</h2>

<p><code>keys</code> returned from an lvalue subroutine can no longer be assigned to in list context.</p>

<pre><code>    sub foo : lvalue { keys(%INC) }
    (foo) = 3; # death
    sub bar : lvalue { keys(@_) }
    (bar) = 3; # also an error</code></pre>

<p>This makes the lvalue sub case consistent with <code>(keys %hash) = ...</code> and <code>(keys @_) = ...</code>, which are also errors. [perl #128187]</p>

<ul>

<li><p><i>make_ext.pl</i> no longer updates a module&#39;s <i>pm_to_blib</i> file when no files require updates. This could cause dependencies, <i>perlmain.c</i> in particular, to be rebuilt unnecessarily. [perl #126710]</p>

</li>
<li><p>The output of <code>perl -V</code> has been reformatted so that each configuration and compile-time option is now listed one per line, to improve readability.</p>

</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p><code> until ($x = 1) { ... } </code> and <code> ... until $x = 1 </code> now properly warn when syntax warnings are enabled. [perl #127333]</p>

</li>
<li><p>socket() now leaves the error code returned by the system in <code>$!</code> on failure. [perl #128316]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Assignment variants of any bitwise ops under the <code>bitwise</code> feature would crash if the left-hand side was an array or hash. [perl #128204]</p>

</li>
<li><p><code>require</code> followed by a single colon (as in <code>foo() ? require : ...</code> is now parsed correctly as <code>require</code> with implicit $_, rather than <code>require &quot;&quot;</code>. [perl #128307]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Scalar <code>keys %hash</code> can now be assigned to consistently in all scalar lvalue contexts. Previously it worked for some contexts but not others.</p>

</li>
<li><p>List assignment to <code>vec</code> or <code>substr</code> with an array or hash for its first argument used to result in crashes or &quot;Can&#39;t coerce&quot; error messages at run time, unlike scalar assignment, which would give an error at compile time. List assignment now gives a compile-time error, too. [perl #128260]</p>
