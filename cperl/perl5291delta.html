<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perl5291delta - what is new for perl v5.29.1</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.29.0 release and the 5.29.1 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read <a href="/cperl/perl5290delta.html">perl5290delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.29.0.</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<h2 id="Delimiters-must-now-be-graphemes">Delimiters must now be graphemes</h2>

<p>See <a href="/cperl/perldeprecation.html#Use-of-unassigned-code-point-or-non-standalone-grapheme-for-a-delimiter">&quot;Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter.&quot; in perldeprecation</a></p>

<h2 id="Some-formerly-deprecated-uses-of-an-unescaped-left-brace-in-regular-expression-patterns-are-now-illegal">Some formerly deprecated uses of an unescaped left brace <code>&quot;{&quot;</code> in regular expression patterns are now illegal</h2>

<p>But to avoid breaking code unnecessarily, most instances that issued a deprecation warning, remain legal and now have a non-deprecation warning raised. See <a href="/cperl/perldeprecation.html#Unescaped-left-braces-in-regular-expressions">&quot;Unescaped left braces in regular expressions&quot; in perldeprecation</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Translating from UTF-8 into the code point it represents now is done via a deterministic finite automaton, speeding it up. As a typical example, <code>ord(&quot;\x7fff&quot;)</code> now requires 12% fewer instructions than before. The performance of checking that a sequence of bytes is valid UTF-8 is similarly improved, again by using a dfa.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Documentation">Documentation</h1>

<h2 id="Changes-to-Existing-Documentation">Changes to Existing Documentation</h2>

<p>We have attempted to update the documentation to reflect the changes listed in this document. If you find any we have missed, send email to <a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the following selected changes have been made:</p>

<h3 id="perlapi"><a href="/cperl/perlapi.html">perlapi</a></h3>

<ul>

<li><p><code>AvFILL()</code> was wrongly listed as deprecated. This has been corrected. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133278">[perl #133278]</a></p>

</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="perlop"><a href="/cperl/perlop.html">perlop</a></h3>

<ul>

<li><p>The behaviour of <code>tr</code> when the delimiter is an apostrophe has been clarified. In particular, hyphens aren&#39;t special, and <code>\x{}</code> isn&#39;t interpolated. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=130679">[perl #130679]</a></p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Diagnostics">Diagnostics</h1>

<p>The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see <a href="/cperl/perldiag.html">perldiag</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Changes-to-Existing-Diagnostics">Changes to Existing Diagnostics</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>As noted under <a href="#Incompatible-Changes">&quot;Incompatible Changes&quot;</a> above, the deprecation warning &quot;Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/&quot; has been changed to the non-deprecation warning &quot;Unescaped left brace in regex is passed through in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/&quot;.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Testing">Testing</h1>

<p>Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes in this release.</p>

<h1 id="Platform-Support">Platform Support</h1>

<h2 id="Platform-Specific-Notes">Platform-Specific Notes</h2>

<dl>

<dt id="HP-UX-11.11">HP-UX 11.11</dt>
<dd>

<p>An obscure problem in <code>pack()</code> when compiling with HP C-ANSI-C has been fixed by disabling optimizations in <i>pp_pack.c</i>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="Windows">Windows</dt>
<dd>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>USE_CPLUSPLUS</code> build option which has long been available in <i>win32/Makefile</i> (for <b>nmake</b>) and <i>win32/makefile.mk</i> (for <b>dmake</b>) is now also available in <i>win32/GNUmakefile</i> (for <b>gmake</b>).</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <b>nmake</b> makefile no longer defaults to Visual C++ 6.0 (a very old version which is unlikely to be widely used today). As a result, it is now a requirement to specify the <code>CCTYPE</code> since there is no obvious choice of which modern version to default to instead. Failure to specify <code>CCTYPE</code> will result in an error being output and the build will stop.</p>

<p>(The <b>dmake</b> and <b>gmake</b> makefiles will automatically detect which compiler is being used, so do not require <code>CCTYPE</code> to be set. This feature has not yet been added to the <b>nmake</b> makefile.)</p>

</li>
</ul>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Compilation under <code>-DPERL_MEM_LOG</code> and <code>-DNO_LOCALE</code> have been fixed.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Perl 5.28 introduced an <code>index()</code> optimization when comparing to -1 (or indirectly, e.g. &gt;= 0). When this optimization was triggered inside a <code>when</code> clause it caused a warning (&quot;Argument %s isn&#39;t numeric in smart match&quot;). This has now been fixed. <a href="https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=133368">[perl #133368]</a></p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Perl 5.29.1 represents approximately 3 weeks of development since Perl 5.29.0 and contains approximately 68,000 lines of changes across 510 files from 18 authors.</p>

<p>Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 62,000 lines of changes to 320 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.</p>

<p>Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.29.1:</p>

<p>Chris &#39;BinGOs&#39; Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Manns&aring;ker, Daniel Dragan, David Mitchell, Fran&ccedil;ois Perrad, H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van der Sanden, James E Keenan, Jerry D. Hedden, Jim Cromie, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Nicholas Clark, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tina M&uuml;ller, Yves Orton.</p>

<p>The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>

<p>Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl&#39;s core. We&#39;re grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of all of Perl&#39;s historical contributors, please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 id="Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at <a href="https://rt.perl.org/">https://rt.perl.org/</a> . There may also be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <a>perlbug</a> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see <a href="/cperl/perlsec.html#SECURITY-VULNERABILITY-CONTACT-INFORMATION">&quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec</a> for details of how to report the issue.</p>

<h1 id="Give-Thanks">Give Thanks</h1>

<p>If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5, you can do so by running the <code>perlthanks</code> program:</p>

<pre><code>    perlthanks</code></pre>

<p>This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.</p>
