<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>perl5259delta - what is new for perl v5.25.9</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.25.8 release and the 5.25.9 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.25.7, first read <a href="/cperl/perl5258delta.html">perl5258delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.25.7 and 5.25.8.</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<h2 id="New-regular-expression-modifier-xx">New regular expression modifier <code>/xx</code></h2>

<p>Specifying two <code>x</code> characters to modify a regular expression pattern does everything that a single one does, but additionally TAB and SPACE characters within a bracketed character class are generally ignored and can be added to improve readability, like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>/[ ^ A-Z d-f p-x ]/xx</code></span>. Details are at <a href="/cperl/perlre.html#x-and-xx">&quot;/x and /xx&quot; in perlre</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Deprecations">Deprecations</h1>

<h2 id="String-delimiters-that-arent-stand-alone-graphemes-are-now-deprecated">String delimiters that aren&#39;t stand-alone graphemes are now deprecated</h2>

<p>In order for Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode grapheme clusters (which look like a single character, but may be a sequence of several ones), we have to stop allowing a single char delimiter that isn&#39;t a grapheme by itself. These are unlikely to exist in actual code, as they would typically display as attached to the character in front of them.</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>A hash in boolean context is now sometimes faster, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>    if (!%h) { ... }</code></pre>

<p>This was already special-cased, but some cases were missed, and even the ones which weren&#39;t have been improved.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Several other ops may now also be faster in boolean context.</p>

</li>
</ul>

When <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>re &#39;strict&#39;</code></span> is enabled, a warning now will be generated for all unescaped uses of the two characters <code>}</code> and <code>]</code> in regular expression patterns (outside bracketed character classes) that are taken literally. This brings them more in line with the <code>)</code> character which is always a metacharacter unless escaped. Being a metacharacter only sometimes, depending on action at a distance, can lead to silently having the pattern mean something quite different than was intended, which the <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>re &#39;strict&#39;</code></span> mode is intended to minimize.</p>

<h3 id="perldeprecation"><a href="/cperl/perldeprecation.html">perldeprecation</a></h3>

<p>This file documents all upcoming deprecations, and some of the deprecations which already have been removed. The purpose of this documentation is two-fold: document what will disappear, and by which version, and serve as a guide for people dealing with code which has features that no longer work after an upgrade of their perl.</p>

<h1 id="Diagnostics">Diagnostics</h1>

<p>The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output, including warnings and fatal error messages. For the complete list of diagnostic messages, see <a href="/cperl/perldiag.html">perldiag</a>.</p>

<h3 id="New-Warnings">New Warnings</h3>

<ul>

<li><p><a href="/cperl/perldiag.html#Use-of-unassigned-code-point-or-non-standalone-grapheme-for-a-delimiter-will-be-a-fatal-error-starting-in-Perl-v5.30">Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a delimiter will be a fatal error starting in Perl v5.30</a></p>

<p>See <a href="#Deprecations">&quot;Deprecations&quot;</a></p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Changes-to-Existing-Diagnostics">Changes to Existing Diagnostics</h2>

<p>As of Perl 5.25.9, all new deprecations will come with a version in which the feature will disappear. And with a few exceptions, most existing deprecations will state when they&#39;ll disappear. As such, most deprecation messages have changed.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Attribute &quot;locked&quot; is deprecated, and will disappear in Perl 5.28</p>

</li>
<li><p>Attribute &quot;unique&quot; is deprecated, and will disappear in Perl 5.28</p>

</li>
<li><p>&quot;\c%c&quot; is more clearly written simply as &quot;%s&quot;. This will be a fatal error in Perl 5.28</p>

</li>
<li><p>Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are deprecated. This will not be allowed in Perl 5.32</p>

</li>
<li><p>Deprecated use of my() in false conditional. This will be a fatal error in Perl 5.30</p>

</li>
<li><p>dump() better written as CORE::dump(). dump() will no longer be available in Perl 5.30</p>

</li>
<li><p>${^ENCODING} is no longer supported. Its use will be fatal in Perl 5.28</p>

</li>
<li><p>File::Glob::glob() will disappear in perl 5.30. Use File::Glob::bsd_glob() instead.</p>

</li>
<li><p>%s() is deprecated on :utf8 handles. This will be a fatal error in Perl 5.30</p>

</li>
<li><p>$* is no longer supported. Its use will be fatal in Perl 5.30</p>

</li>
<li><p>$* is no longer supported. Its use will be fatal in Perl 5.30</p>

</li>
<li><p>Opening dirhandle %s also as a file. This will be a fatal error in Perl 5.28</p>

</li>
<li><p>Opening filehandle %s also as a directory. This will be a fatal error in Perl 5.28</p>

</li>
<li><p>Setting $/ to a reference to %s as a form of slurp is deprecated, treating as undef. This will be fatal in Perl 5.28</p>

</li>
<li><p>Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated here (and will be fatal in Perl 5.30), passed through in regex; marked by <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&lt;-- HERE</span> in m/%s/</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Utility-Changes">Utility Changes</h1>

<h2 id="c2ph-and-pstruct"><i>c2ph</i> and <i>pstruct</i></h2>

<ul>

<li><p>These old utilities have long since superceded by <a>h2xs</a>, and are now gone from the distribution.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Porting-sync-with-cpan"><i>Porting/sync-with-cpan</i></h2>

<ul>

<li><p>Many improvements</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Configuration-and-Compilation">Configuration and Compilation</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>The <code>dtrace</code> build process has further changes:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If the <code>-xnolibs</code> is available, use that so a <i>dtrace</i> perl can be built within a FreeBSD jail.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On systems that build a dtrace object file (FreeBSD, Solaris and SystemTap&#39;s dtrace emulation), copy the input objects to a separate directory and process them there, and use those objects in the link, since <code>dtrace -G</code> also modifies these objects.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Add libelf to the build on FreeBSD 10.x, since dtrace adds references to libelf symbols.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Generate a dummy dtrace_main.o if <code>dtrace -G</code> fails to build it. A default build on Solaris generates probes from the unused inline functions, while they don&#39;t on FreeBSD, which causes <code>dtrace -G</code> to fail.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>[perl #130108]</p>

</li>
<li><p>You can now disable perl&#39;s use of the PERL_HASH_SEED and PERL_PERTURB_KEYS environment variables by configuring perl with <code>-Accflags=NO_PERL_HASH_ENV</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>You can now disable perl&#39;s use of the PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG environment variable by configuring perl with <code>-Accflags=-DNO_PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG</code>.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Internal-Changes">Internal Changes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>New versions of macros like <code>isALPHA_utf8</code> and <code>toLOWER_utf8</code> have been added, each with the suffix <code>_safe</code>, like <code>isSPACE_utf8_safe</code>. These take an extra parameter, giving an upper limit of how far into the string it is safe to read. Using the old versions could cause attempts to read beyond the end of the input buffer if the UTF-8 is not well-formed, and their use now raises a deprecation warning. Details are at <a href="/cperl/perlapi.html#Character-classification">&quot;Character classification&quot; in perlapi</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Calling macros like <code>isALPHA_utf8</code> on malformed UTF-8 have issued a deprecation warning since Perl v5.18. They now die. Similarly, macros like <code>toLOWER_utf8</code> on malformed UTF-8 now die.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Calling the functions <code>utf8n_to_uvchr</code> and its derivatives, while passing a string length of 0 is now asserted against in DEBUGGING builds, and otherwise returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. If you have nothing to decode, you shouldn&#39;t call the decode function.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The functions <code>utf8n_to_uvchr</code> and its derivatives now return the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER if called with UTF-8 that has the overlong malformation, and that malformation is allowed by the input parameters. This malformation is where the UTF-8 looks valid syntactically, but there is a shorter sequence that yields the same code point. This has been forbidden since Unicode version 3.1.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The functions <code>utf8n_to_uvchr</code> and its derivatives now accept an input flag to allow the overflow malformation. This malformation is when the UTF-8 may be syntactically valid, but the code point it represents is not capable of being represented in the word length on the platform. What &quot;allowed&quot; means in this case is that the function doesn&#39;t return an error, and advances the parse pointer to beyond the UTF-8 in question, but it returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as the value of the code point (since the real value is not representable).</p>

</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="Selected-Bug-Fixes">Selected Bug Fixes</h1>

<ul>

<li><p>Under <code>use utf8</code>, the entire Perl program is now checked that the UTF-8 is wellformed. This resolves [perl #126310].</p>

</li>
<li><p>The range operator <code>..</code> on strings now handles its arguments correctly when in the scope of the <a><code>unicode_strings</code></a> feature. The previous behaviour was sufficiently unexpected that we believe no correct program could have made use of it.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">split</span> operator did not ensure enough space was allocated for its return value in scalar context. It could then write a single pointer immediately beyond the end of the memory block allocated for the stack. [perl #130262]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Using a large code point with the <code>W</code> pack template character with the current output position aligned at just the right point could cause a write a single zero byte immediately beyond the end of an allocated buffer. [perl #129149]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Supplying the form picture argument as part of the form argument list where the picture specifies modifying the argument could cause an access to the new freed compiled form. [perl #129125]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix a problem with sort&#39;s build-in compare, where it would not sort correctly with 64-bit integers, and non-long doubles. [perl #130335]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix issues with /(?{ ... &lt;&lt;EOF })/ that broke Method-Signatures. [perl #130398]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix a macro which caused syntax error on an EBCDIC build.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Prevent tests from getting hung up on &#39;NonStop&#39; option. [perl #130445]</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed an assertion failure with <code>chop</code> and <code>chomp</code>, which could be triggered by <code>chop(@x =~ tr/1/1/)</code>. [perl #130198].</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fixed a comment skipping error under <code>/x</code>; it could stop skipping a byte early, which could be in the middle of a UTF-8 character. [perl #130495].</p>

</li>
<li><p><i>perldb</i> now ignores <i>/dev/tty</i> on non-Unix systems. [perl #113960];</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix assertion failure for <code>{}-&gt;$x</code> when <code>$x</code> isn&#39;t defined. [perl #130496].</p>

</li>
<li><p>DragonFly BSD now has support for setproctitle(). [perl #130068].</p>

</li>
<li><p>Fix an assertion error which could be triggered when lookahead string in patterns exceeded a minimum length. [perl #130522].</p>

</li>
<li><p>Only warn once per literal about a misplaced <code>_</code>. [perl #70878].</p>

</li>
<li><p>Ensure range-start is set after error in <code>tr///</code>. [perl #129342].</p>

</li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t read past start of string for unmatched backref; otherwise, we may have heap buffer overflow. [perl #129377].</p>

</li>
<li><p>Properly recognize mathematical digit ranges starting at U+1D7E. <code>use re &#39;strict&#39;</code> is supposed to warn if you use a range whose start and end digit aren&#39;t from the same group of 10. It didn&#39;t do that for five groups of mathematical digits starting at U+1D7E.</p>

</li>
</ul>
