<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p>[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as XXX needs to be processed before release. ]</p>

<p>perldelta - what is new for perl v5.25.9</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>This document describes differences between the 5.25.8 release and the 5.25.9 release.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.25.7, first read <a href="/cperl/perl5258delta.html">perl5258delta</a>, which describes differences between 5.25.7 and 5.25.8.</p>

<h1 id="Notice">Notice</h1>

<p>XXX Any important notices here</p>

<h1 id="Core-Enhancements">Core Enhancements</h1>

<p>XXX New core language features go here. Summarize user-visible core language enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go here, but most should go in the <a href="#Performance-Enhancements">&quot;Performance Enhancements&quot;</a> section.</p>

<h2 id="New-regular-expression-modifier-xx">New regular expression modifier <code>/xx</code></h2>

<p>Specifying two <code>x</code> characters to modify a regular expression pattern does everything that a single one does, but additionally TAB and SPACE characters within a bracketed character class are generally ignored and can be added to improve readability, like <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>/[ ^ A-Z d-f p-x ]/xx</code></span>. Details are at <a href="/cperl/perlre.html#x-and-xx">&quot;/x and /xx&quot; in perlre</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Security">Security</h1>

<p>XXX Any security-related notices go here. In particular, any security vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the <a href="#Selected-Bug-Fixes">&quot;Selected Bug Fixes&quot;</a> section.</p>

<p>[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]</p>

<h1 id="Incompatible-Changes">Incompatible Changes</h1>

<p>XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:</p>

<pre><code>    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L&lt;/Reporting Bugs&gt; below.</code></pre>

<p>[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]</p>

<h1 id="Deprecations">Deprecations</h1>

<h2 id="String-delimiters-that-arent-stand-alone-graphemes-are-now-deprecated">String delimiters that aren&#39;t stand-alone graphemes are now deprecated</h2>

<p>In order for Perl to eventually allow string delimiters to be Unicode grapheme clusters (which look like a single character, but may be a sequence of several ones), we have to stop allowing a single char delimiter that isn&#39;t a grapheme by itself. These are unlikely to exist in actual code, as they would typically display as attached to the character in front of them.</p>

<h2 id="Module-removals">Module removals</h2>

<p>XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.</p>

<p>The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN. Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as prerequisites.</p>

<p>The core versions of these modules will now issue <code>&quot;deprecated&quot;</code>-category warnings to alert you to this fact. To silence these deprecation warnings, install the modules in question from CPAN.</p>

<p>Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation, not usually on concerns over their design.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="XXX">XXX</dt>
<dd>

<p>XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed as an updated module in the <a href="#Modules-and-Pragmata">&quot;Modules and Pragmata&quot;</a> section.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>[ List each other deprecation as a =head2 entry ]</p>

<h1 id="Performance-Enhancements">Performance Enhancements</h1>

<p>XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There may well be none in a stable release.</p>

<p>[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]</p>

<h1 id="Modules-and-Pragmata">Modules and Pragmata</h1>

<p>XXX All changes to installed files in <i>cpan/</i>, <i>dist/</i>, <i>ext/</i> and <i>lib/</i> go here. If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the following sections using <i>Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl</i>. A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand. In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a <i>Changes</i> file that could be cribbed.</p>

<p>[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]</p>

<li><p><a>XXX</a> has been upgraded from version A.xx to B.yy.</p>

</li>
<li><p><a>re</a> has been upgraded from version 0.33 to 0.34;</p>

<p>This adds support for the new <a href="/cperl/perlre.html#x-and-xx"><code>/xx</code></a> regular expression pattern modifier, and a change to the <a><span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>use re &#39;strict&#39;</code></span></a> experimental feature. When <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>re &#39;strict&#39;</code></span> is enabled, a warning now will be generated for all unescaped uses of the two characters <code>}</code> and <code>]</code> in regular expression patterns (outside bracketed character classes) that are taken literally. This brings them more in line with the <code>)</code> character which is always a metacharacter unless escaped. Being a metacharacter only sometimes, depending on action at a distance, can lead to silently having the pattern mean something quite different than was intended, which the <span style="white-space: nowrap;"><code>re &#39;strict&#39;</code></span> mode is intended to minimize.</p>

<li><p>If the <code>-xnolibs</code> is available, use that so a <i>dtrace</i> perl can be built within a FreeBSD jail.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On systems that build a dtrace object file (FreeBSD, Solaris and SystemTap&#39;s dtrace emulation), copy the input objects to a separate directory and process them there, and use those objects in the link, since <code>dtrace -G</code> also modifies these objects.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Add libelf to the build on FreeBSD 10.x, since dtrace adds references to libelf symbols.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Generate a dummy dtrace_main.o if <code>dtrace -G</code> fails to build it. A default build on Solaris generates probes from the unused inline functions, while they don&#39;t on FreeBSD, which causes <code>dtrace -G</code> to fail.</p>

<p>[ List each change as a =item entry ]</p>

<ul>

<li><p>New versions of macros like <code>isALPHA_utf8</code> and <code>toLOWER_utf8</code> have been added, each with the suffix <code>_safe</code>, like <code>isSPACE_utf8_safe</code>. These take an extra parameter, giving an upper limit of how far into the string it is safe to read. Using the old versions could cause attempts to read beyond the end of the input buffer if the UTF-8 is not well-formed, and ther use now raises a deprecation warning. Details are at <a href="/cperl/perlapi.html#Character-classification">&quot;Character classification&quot; in perlapi</a>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Calling macros like <code>isALPHA_utf8</code> on malformed UTF-8 have issued a deprecation warning since Perl v5.18. They now die. Similarly, macros like <code>toLOWER_utf8</code> on malformed UTF-8 now die.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Calling the functions <code>utf8n_to_uvchr</code> and its derivatives, while passing a string length of 0 is now asserted against in DEBUGGING builds, and otherwise returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. If you have nothing to decode, you shouldn&#39;t call the decode function.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The functions <code>utf8n_to_uvchr</code> and its derivatives now return the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER if called with UTF-8 that has the overlong malformation, and that malformation is allowed by the input parameters. This malformation is where the UTF-8 looks valid syntactically, but there is a shorter sequence that yields the same code point. This has been forbidden since Unicode version 3.1.</p>

</li>
<li><p>The functions <code>utf8n_to_uvchr</code> and its derivatives now accept an input flag to allow the overflow malformation. This malformation is when the UTF-8 may be syntactically valid, but the code point it represents is not capable of being represented in the word length on the platform. What &quot;allowed&quot; means in this case is that the function doesn&#39;t return an error, and advances the parse pointer to beyond the UTF-8 in question, but it returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER as the value of the code point (since the real value is not representable).</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <a>perlbug</a> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see <a href="/cperl/perlsec.html#SECURITY-VULNERABILITY-CONTACT-INFORMATION">&quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec</a> for details of how to report the issue.</p>
