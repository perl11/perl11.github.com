<h1 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>Perl 5.26.1 represents approximately 0 weeks of development since Perl 5.26.0 and contains approximately 7,200 lines of changes across 43 files from 2 authors.</p>

<p>Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools, there were approximately 72 lines of changes to 8 .pm, .t, .c and .h files.</p>

<p>Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.1:</p>

<p>Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X.</p>

<p>The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>

<p>Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules included in Perl&#39;s core. We&#39;re grateful to the entire CPAN community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of all of Perl&#39;s historical contributors, please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 id="Reporting-Bugs">Reporting Bugs</h1>

<p>If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at <a href="https://rt.perl.org/">https://rt.perl.org/</a> . There may also be information at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a> , the Perl Home Page.</p>

<p>If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the <a>perlbug</a> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of <code>perl -V</code>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see <a href="/cperl/perlsec.html#SECURITY-VULNERABILITY-CONTACT-INFORMATION">&quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec</a> for details of how to report the issue.</p>
