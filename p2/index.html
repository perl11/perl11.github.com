p2 is a she. She will be a perl5 and possible perl6/nqp backend, based
on why the luck stiff&#8217;s <a href="potion.html">potion</a> compiler,
parser and vm technology.
See the potion <span class="caps"><a href="https://github.com/perl11/potion/blob/p2/README">
README<a/></span> why potion is exciting.

<pre>

</pre>

Its exciting points for perl folks are:

<ul>
  <li>Should parse most of perl5, just some XS and B tricks not.<br />
    Since the original perl5 testsuite is not usable for other<br />
    implementations and compilers it needs to be adjusted. The perl6<br />
    testsuite is in a better shape.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>signatures, types, mixins, traits, fast native threads, coroutines for perl5.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Using most of Damian Conway&#8217;s p5i recommendations:<br />
    i.e. classes are immutable and final by default.<br />
    See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040207072905/http://www.yetanother.org/damian/Perl5+i/">www.yetanother.org/damian/Perl5+i/</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>libp2 should be usable as a fast backend for nqp/perl6.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Native and fast calling convention, no XS stack args on the heap.<br />
    XS is replaced by dlcall (dynamic ffi), and/or shared libraries with<br />
    normal function calls into the vm.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>int, str, num are objects, you can optionally type all args and lexical variables.<br />
    In fact everything is an object as in parrot, even the compiler, the parser, the vm.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Sized arrays are non-autovivifying and initialized with undef, resp. if typed 0, 0.0, &quot;&quot;.<br />
<pre>
     my $a[3]; print $a[3];    =&gt; compile-time error: array out of bounds
     my int $i[3]; print $a[2] =&gt; 0
     my num $n[3]; print $n[2] =&gt; 0.0
     my str $s[3]; print $a[2] =&gt; &quot;&quot;
</pre>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A new pragma &#8220;no magic&#8221; applies to all visible objects in scope.</li>
<pre>
     {
       no magic;
       use Config;
       print $Config{&#8217;ccflags&#8217;};
     }
     =&gt; compile-time error: Invalid use of tie with no magic
</pre>

use
<pre>
     {
       no magic;
       use Config;
       print $Config::Config{&#8217;ccflags&#8217;};
     }
</pre>
instead.

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>p6-like meta-objmodel: :multi, type-optimizer. Like Moose, just better and much faster. 
<i>(800x as first rough estimation)</i></li>

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>smartmatch works because all data are typed objects.</li>
</ul>

<div id="potion"><img src="potion-1.png" /></div>

<ul>
  <li>Just-in-time compilation for x86, x86-64 and ppc done.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Intermediate bytecode format and VM. Load and dump code.  Decent<br />
    speed and cross-architecture. Heavily based on <a href="http://nekovm.org/lua">Lua&#8217;s VM</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A multi-threaded concurrent generational GC, based on Stefan Seifert's <br />
    work on hybrid <a href="http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/day-11-parrot-threads/">parrot threads</a> with proxies to safely update foreign<br />
    variables via coroutines.<br />
    The compiler will add hooks for objects leaving scope and add<br />
   <span class="caps">DESTROY</span> method calls if they are visible at compile-time.<br />
    Run-time created <span class="caps">DESTROY</span> methods will not be automatically called.</li>

  <li>The current potion generational GC is based on Basile Starynkevitch&#8217;s<br />
    work on <a href="http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/qishintro.html">Qish</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Bootstrapped <a href="http://piumarta.com/software/id-objmodel/">&#8220;id&#8221; object model</a>, based on Ian Piumarta&#8217;s <a href="http://piumarta.com/software/cola/">soda</a><br />
    languages.  This means everything in the language, including<br />
    object allocation and interpreter state are part of the object<br />
    model.  (See <span class="caps"><a href="https://github.com/perl11/potion/blob/p2/COPYING">COPYING</a></span> for citations.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Interpreter is thread-safe and reentrant.  I hope this will<br />
    facilitate coroutines, parallel interpreters and sandboxing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Small. Under 10kloc. Right now we&#8217;re like 6,000 or<br />
    something. Install sloccount and run: make sloc.<br />
    No configure, just make.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Reified <span class="caps">AST</span> and bytecode structures. This is very important to<br />
    me. By giving access to the parser and compiler, it allows people<br />
    to target other platforms, write code analysis tools and even<br />
    fully bootstrapped VMs. I&#8217;m not as concerned about the Potion VM<br />
    being fully bootstrapped, especially as it is tied into the <span class="caps">JIT</span><br />
    so closely.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Memory-efficient classes. Stored like C structs. (Although the<br />
    method lookup table can be used like a hash for storing arbitrary<br />
    data.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The <span class="caps">JIT</span> is also used to speed up some other bottlenecks. For<br />
    example, instance variable and method lookup tables are compiled<br />
    into machine code.</li>
</ul>

However, some warnings:
<ul>
  <li>Strings are immutable (like Lua and parrot) and byte arrays are used for I/O<br />
    buffers. Strings are utf-8 only, de/encoding done in library functions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>No arbitrary precision for numbers yet. (automatic promotion to bigint, bignum, bigrat)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>No error handling yet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>No signal handling yet.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>thankyous</h1>

<p>why the lucky stiff left the ruby community. potion was his last
public project. It&#8217;s a work of art and mastership. I could not
think of anything better. I think it is better than go, if potion
would have had dlcall, autothreads and channels, arbitrary precision
numbers and exception handling.<p>

Rob Pike for <a href="http://www.golang.org/">go</a>, and the parrot community for <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">parrot</a>.<p>
<a href="http://cpanel.net/">cPanel</a> for letting me do what I 
consider important. Not just 10% of my time as with Google.<p>

Larry Wall for perl5. We miss his leadership and technical excellence.
Without him nothing got done, and *if* something was done it was wrong.
Besides defined-or, which left Tom Christiansen behind.<p>

why the lucky stiff thanks:<p>

I am gravely indebted to Basile Starynkevitch, who fielded my
questions about his garbage collector. I favor French hackers
to an extreme (Xavier Leroy, Nicolas Cannasse, Guy Decoux,
Mathieu Bochard to name only a portion of those I admire) and
am very glad to represent their influence in Potion&#8217;s garbage
collector.<p>

Matz, for answering my questions about conservative GC and
for encouraging me so much. Potion&#8217;s stack scanning code and
some of the object model come from Ruby.<p>

Steve Dekorte for the <a href="http://iolanguage.org/">Io</a> language, <a href="http://dekorte.com/projects/opensource/libgarbagecollector/">libgarbagecollector</a> and
<a href="http://dekorte.com/projects/opensource/libcoroutine/">libcoroutine</a> &#8212; I referred frequently to all of them in sorting out what I wanted.<p>

Of course, Mauricio Fernandez for his inspiring programming
journal housed at <a href="http://eigenclass.org/R2/">eigenclass.org/R2/</a> and for works
derived throughout the course of it &#8212; extprot most of all.
Many of my thoughts about language internals (object repr, GC, etc.) are informed by him.<p>

Ian Piumarta for <a href="http://piumarta.com/software/peg/">peg/leg</a> and <a href="http://piumarta.com/software/id-objmodel/">id-objmodel</a>. I use a re-entrant custom version of peg, but the original library is sheer minimalist parsing amazement.<p>

Final appreciations to Jonathan Wright and William Morgan
who pitched in, back in the wee hours of Potion&#8217;s history.
Thanks.<p>
