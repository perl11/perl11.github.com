<h1>design decisions on p2</h1>
<p>With p2 I plan to parse and execute perl5 asis.<br />
libp2, the compiler and vm based on potion, should be a good target<br />
for perl6.</p>
<p>But I will not be able to run 100% of <span class="caps">CPAN</span>. I could, but then there<br />
would be no progress.<br />
I plan significant enhancements in perl performance and features.</p>
<h2>Generally</h2>
<p>I go along with _why and every lisp coder. Good software should be<br />
beautiful. It&#8217;s art not technology.<br />
short, precise, readable. no one wants to work with a big and ugly mess,<br />
not even companies. rather restrict the usage to those who know and<br />
can be taught, than sacrifice your system for it.  support 90% but do<br />
not sacrifice for the rest.  gmake and gcc/clang are available<br />
everywhere, even on pure bsd&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
no support for MS cl/nmake, people should use mingw with gmake and gcc instead.<br />
no support for BSDmakefile syntax (see the bsd branch).<br />
no support for pure strict c++ compilers (see the p2-c++ branch).<br />
no vax, hpux, aix without gnu tools</p>
<h1>Incompatibilities</h1>
<p>Some functionality will change, some annoying bugs fixed, <br />
and some functionality might get removed, or not yet supported.</p>
<h2>XS</h2>
<p>Problem will arise with XS code, since the VM is different, and not<br />
all XS <span class="caps">API</span> functions can be supported.  It should be much easier to<br />
use XS-like functionality with the new <span class="caps">FFI</span>, or by using extension<br />
libraries with native calls. See <code>lib/readline</code>. So we will loose<br />
40% of <span class="caps">CPAN</span> code, but will win on performance, expressibility and<br />
compile-time error checking when binding libs.</p>
<p>There should be a translator of old XS code to check the stack<br />
(argument + return values) handling macros and convert them to direct<br />
calls.</p>
<h2>functional programming support</h2>
<p>Some side-effect-only functions will be changed to return the<br />
changed argument.<br />
E.g. <code>chop, chomp, &#8230;</code></p>
<p>The parser will be different. Most statements will return values.<br />
E.g. <span class="caps">if</span> returns the value of the executed branch or<br />
<span class="caps">undef</span> if no branch is choosen.<br />
<code>$a = if (1) { $c }; # same as: $a = $c</code></p>

<h2>order of destruction</h2>
<p>If you don&#8217;t use explicit <span class="caps">DESTROY</span> calls at the end of blocks, the compiler <br />
might miss some <span class="caps">DESTROY</span> calls of untyped objects. <span class="caps">DESTROY</span> might be called<br />
later then, as in other GC&#8217;d languages. get over it.</p>
<p>reference counted objects are too dangerous, too hard and too slow.<br />
cyclic data structures do not play well with refcounts.<br />
use-after-free bugs are by factor 10 the most exploited security problems<br />
nowadays, and perl5 is full of them.</p>
<h2>lexical hash iterators</h2>
<p>iterating a hash twice in lexically scoped blocks does not work in the second, <br />
outer iterator, as the iterator in p5p perl is stored in the data. <br />
This will be changed to be stored in the scope (block).</p>
<p>i.e. using Data::Dumper inside a each %hash loop will restore the position after <br />
Data::Dumper dumped the hash.</p>
<h1>New features (planned)</h1>
<h3>All data are objects, all declarations can be optionally typed.</h3>
<p>extendability, maintainance</p>
<p>efficient oo and dynamic type system, with compiler support for static types.</p>
<h3>const declarations for lexical data, @ISA, classes and functions/methods</h3>
<p>efficiency</p>
<p>Also needed for threads and oo to avoid generating writer methods.<br />
Define immutable and final classes.</p>
<h3>optional function signatures and type declarations</h3>
<p>efficiency and safety, compile-time checks</p>
<h3>efficient meta-object system, with classes, methods, roles</h3>
<p>like Moose (i.e. <span class="caps">CLOS</span>), but ~800x faster and with native type support.<br />
i.e. compile-time checks.</p>
<h3>sized arrays</h3>
<p>efficiency</p>
<h3>no magic</h3>
<p>efficiency</p>
<h3>match operator</h3>
<p>expressibility</p>
<p>A proper matcher should be able to match structures and types, and to<br />
bind result variables.</p>
<h3>dynamic and cleaned up parser</h3>
<p>maintainability.<br />
new technology (risc and code maintainability), but needed for macros.</p>
<p>allow sensible language features, disallowed by p5p or the old yacc<br />
parser.  the parser grammar needs to be expressive, even for perl,<br />
which is known to be hard to parse, and dynamic at parse-time<br />
(prototypes).</p>
<p>new syntactic constructs needs to added to the grammar, not elsewhere<br />
in the code.  the parser needs to be accessible and extendable at<br />
compile-time, maybe even run-time, but we cannot use a non-optimized<br />
pure top-down parser as e.g. lua to enable this.</p>
<p>we need to precompile the base grammar, bootstrap system macros and<br />
allow user macros. expose the parser <span class="caps">API</span> to the user. query and<br />
insert rules. use custom rules to parse ffi declarations (c headers)<br />
templates, &#8230; or even basic, ruby, python or perl6.</p>
<pre><code>
  {
    use v6;
    # perl6 syntax...
  }
</code></pre>
<p><em>(this will need a pre-compiled <code>syntax-p6.g</code> and scoped syntax)</em></p>
<p>Either done by extending packrat greg (ie leg) by with a parser<br />
interpreter to add rules at run-time, &#8211; from precompiled rules and<br />
user-added rules &#8211; or by extending marpa to be extensible.</p>
<h3>macros as parser extensions</h3>
<p>expressibility (lisp-like)<br />
keep the vm small, do not prototype everything in the C library.<br />
use the existing parser engine.</p>
<p>macro args are rules (non-terminals) and terminals (strings) to be<br />
added to the parser, the macro block is evaluated at compile-time,<br />
with `&#8230;` expanded at run-time.</p>
<p>so perl will be the first non-lisp like language with a proper macro<br />
system, i.e. extending parser grammars. perl6 has similar ideas using peg<br />
at run-time, but their syntactic macros are too complicated for me.<br />
maybe using the perl6 <rule> syntax looks ok. <em>(i.e. <block> below)</em></p>
<p>There are some similar non-mainstream approaches, on mono or java or<br />
haskell, but none on fast, compiled to C scripting languages.</p>
<pre><code>
  syntax-p5.g:
    block = '{' s:statements* '}' { $$ = PN_AST(BLOCK, s); }
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
  macro ifdebug block 'ifdebug' {
    if ($DEBUG) `block`;
  }
  { call() } ifdebug;
</code></pre>
<h3>auto-threads</h3>
<p>the p2/potion data-structures, compiler, vm, gc, interpreter are<br />
thread-safe.</p>
<p>with a OO task and scheduler interface as in parrot (pre-create,<br />
useful esp. for windows alarms),<br />
or as in Go (similar),<br />
or maybe only non-autothreaded as in lua, with just first-class<br />
  coroutines, methods: create, status, resume, yield, wrap</p>
<h3>ffi</h3>
<p>builtin<br />
extendability, maintainance</p>
<p>maybe ctypes alike, maybe something simplier or more advanced.<br />
(i.e. import parses header files and generates all ffi functions<br />
and types, or on the hand only support the bare cc types:<br />
signed/unsigned, void/byte/short/long/ptr float/double/long double)</p>
