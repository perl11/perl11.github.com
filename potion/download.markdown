title: Download Potion
---
Download potion from [here](http://github.com/perl11/potion).
Then unpack potion, cd to that directory, and run:

    $ make

There should be no errors and you should see a welcome message at the end of the output. If anything goes wrong,
report it [here](http://github.com/perl11/potion/issues).

You now have a 'potion' binary in the directory. Optionally, to test it, run:

    $ make test

## ~

    $ ./potion the_file_to_run.pn
